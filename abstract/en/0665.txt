Aim: the accumulation of experience and evaluation of results of treating the patients with perforated giant penetrating duodenal ulcer. 
Patients and methods: the study group included 14 patients operated on for perforated giant penetrating duodenal ulcers in the period from June 2009 to
May 2015. Men - 13 (92,9%), women – 1 (7,1%), aged from 43 to 76 years, an average of 60,85 years (95% CI 55,94-65,77). The extent of operation: distal
gastrectomy by Billroth 2 in the modification of Hofmeister-Finsterer. The third category of A. Guarneri in terms of the complexity of the pyloroduodenal
zone mobilization. The method of forming a "difficult" stump of the duodenum is characterized by: a longitudinal dissection of the anterior wall of the bulb of
the duodenum affected by the circular ulcer process, which makes it possible to use the stenotically altered postbulbary department as a framework, during
the formation of the stump. The use of two-level continuous suture allows to evenly distribute the load on the fabric.
Results: the average duration of surgery was 145,0 minutes (95% CI: 129,5;160,5). The duration of inpatient treatment: from 10 to 26 patient days, with an
average of 16.3 (95% CI: 13,8; 18.8 in). Complications in the early postoperative period: wound infection was 7.1%, pneumonia – 14,3%. The insolvency of
the stitches of the duodenum stump was not revealed. Postoperative mortality was 7.1%. Fibrogastroduodenoscopy was performed 1 year after surgery, its
results were: the superficial gastritis of the stomach stump - 22.2%, erosive gastritis of the stomach stump - 11.1%, ulcer of the gastro-jejunal anastomosis -
11.1 The results of the SF-36 questionnaire in 1 year after the operation in 9 (66.7%) patients:: PF - 42,2±14,2; RP -55,9±30,0; PL - 70,0±21,6; gr -
67,3±16,5; W - 56,7±22,4; SF - 63,9±22,0; re - 59,3±22,2; MN - 62,7±20,0.
Conclusion: using the proposed method of formation of duodenal stump with a circular perforated giant duodenal ulcers helps to minimize the risk of insol-
vency of the seams, is reproducible and can be recommended for use in clinical practice. 
Key words: giant duodenal ulcer perforation, stenosis, penetration, resection of the stomach.
