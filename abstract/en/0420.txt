Peripheral and autonomic neuropathies are among the most common diabetic complications while diabetic neuropathy is the most common neuropathy in
Europe and North America. Large epidemiological studies suggest that diabetic neuropathy develops in 50% of patients with verified diabetes. In diabetes,
the most common neurological syndromes are distal symmetric polyneuropathy, vegetative neuropathy, thoracic and lumbar nerve root disorders,
mononeuropathies, and multiple mononeuropathies. Pathogenic therapy of diabetic neuropathies is to control blood sugar while symptomatic therapy is to
reduce pain. The role of vitamins is still not clear, however, this treatment has gained a great popularity both in Russia and foreign countries. Currently,
complex vitamins with B1, B6, and B12 are considered the most relevant supplements. Neurobion is characterized by the rational composition of active in-
gredients. Physiotherapy significantly improves the quality of life in diabetics. Non-drug solutions are nutrition therapy, physical activity, and physiother-
apeutic procedures.
Key words: diabetic complications, diabetic neuropathy, diabetes, polyneuropathy, mononeuropathy, vitamin therapy, Neurobion, physiotherapy.
