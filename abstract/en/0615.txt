Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a primary chronic inflammation of nasal mucosa. The issue of AR is actual for clinical practice since its prevalence in total popula-
tion is 10-25%. Moreover, in some countries, symptoms which are typical of AR affect up to 50% of the population. Currently, approximately 500 million peo-
ple suffer from AR. The disease is caused by classic IgE-mediated (type 1) response to allergens on the nasal mucosa.
Treatment approach to AR includes several steps, i.e., the primary goal is allergen avoidance followed by pharmacological therapy. Second-generation 
H1-receptor antagonists which are used to treat AR are effective and safe. These drugs inhibit histamine-mediated symptoms and significantly improve qual-
ity of life.
Desloratadine is a systemic long-acting antihistamine which reduces AR symptoms. It is widely used in otorhinolaryngology, allergic practice, and pediatrics.
Multiple studies were performed to assess the effects of desloratadine in AR. These findings confirm that this drug has many advantages over other antihis-
tamines.
Key words: allergic rhinitis, desloratadine, antihistamines, antiallergic therapy.
