The paper reviews the issues regarded diagnosis and treatment of thyroid gland disorders in pregnancy. Physiological changes that are typical of pregnan-
cy should be considered when examining and treating pregnant women. The estimation of TSH normal ranges in pregnancy is discussed. Currently, the oc-
currence of subclinical hypothyroidism is raising. The indications to the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism diagnosed by novel TSH normal ranges are
not determined yet. Sodium levothyroxin provides beneficial effects in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism and anti-TPO antibodies. The influ-
ence of subclinical hypothyroidism on fetal psychoneurological development is not evident. Currently, the safety of anti-thyroid agents in pregnancy is of spe-
cial importance. Previously unrecognized effect of propylthiouracil on the fetus was demonstrated. Additionally, the risk of liver failure due to propylthiouracil
is an issue. Therefore, this agent should be used in the first trimester of pregnancy only. Finally, the paper addresses examination algorithms and treatment
approaches to nodular thyroid gland disorders in pregnant women.
Key words: thyroid gland, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, thyrotoxicosis, thyroid gland nodules.
