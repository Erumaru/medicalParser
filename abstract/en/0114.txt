Comorbidity is the presence of two and/or more pathogenetically interrelated diseases in one patient. It occurs frequently, 
especially in elderly and old patients. Comorbidity increases the severity of the condition, worsens the prognosis and complicates 
the treatment. In the choice of antihypertensive drug, it is important not only to reach the target value of arterial pressure, but 
also to effect the mechanisms of development and the symptoms of concomitant diseases. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are 
involved in modulating the effect of angiotensin on cell growth, proliferation, inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. 
The studies of angiotensin receptor blockers have shown their multiple effects and the possibility of additional positive effects 
in chronic heart failure, myocardial hypertrophy of the left ventricle of the heart, heart rhythm disorders (atrial fibrillation), 
metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, obstructive bronchial diseases, oncological diseases. Further study of the 
problem of comorbidity will allow to specify the prescription of medicines to patients with various cardiovascular diseases and 
concomitant pathology with common pathogenetic mechanisms and to reduce the number of the drugs used in therapy.
Key words: angiotensin II, angiotensin receptor blockers, comorbidity, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, chronic heart 
failure, diabetes mellitus.
