The paper discusses clinical experience with deep myorelaxation in long laparoscopic surgeries. 47-year-old man underwent laparoscopic corpocaudal pan-
createctomy. Intra-abdominal pressure was 11 mm Hg. The surgery has taken 4 hours and 40 minutes while total duration of anesthesia was 5 hours and
20 minutes. Posttetanic count (PTC) was maintained at 2 until the end of basic surgical steps. Total rocuronium dosage was 2.6 mg/kg (200 mg). The sur-
geons considered the conditions for surgical manipulations and visualization as optimal. The reversal of neuromuscular blockade was performed with sug-
ammadex 4 mg/kg (300 mg). The reversal of neuromuscular transmission to TOF ≥90% was achieved after 3 minutes and 42 seconds. Tracheal extubation
was performed in the operating room 12 minutes after the end of the surgery and 6 minutes and 20 seconds after the reversal. This clinical case illustrates
that deep intraoperative myorelaxation in laparoscopic surgical procedures provides novel treatment modalities.
Key words: myorelaxation, residual relaxation, monitoring of neuromuscular transmission, adequacy of anesthesia.
