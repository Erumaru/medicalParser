Arterial hypertension is one of the most important and modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular complications. Renin-angiotonezin-aldosterone system
(RAAS) is extremely important for the regulation of many parameters of the cardiovascular system and kidney function, including maintenance of arterial
pressure and water-salt metabolism. Also, RAAS plays a leading role in the formation of cardiovascular pathology and the development of hypertension, ath-
erosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and chronic heart failure. Angiotensin (AT) II is very important for damaging the target organs, contributing to vaso-
constriction, hypertrophy, fibrosis and remodeling of arterial vessels and myocardium, development of endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis and other dis-
orders. Adverse effects of hyperactivated RAAS are realized through angiotensin II-stimulated AT1 receptors, which is expressed in the provocation of vaso-
contraction and inflammation, in hypertrophy and fibrosis of the heart muscle and blood vessels. Angiotensin receptor blockers selectively prevent the stim-
ulation of AT1 receptors, which are associated with most of the negative effects of angiotensin II. Candesartan is a selective antagonist of angiotensin II type
1 receptors, successfully used in patients with arterial hypertension and chronic heart failure. The article reviews the results of the most significant domes-
tic and international studies on the efficacy and safety of candesartan.
Key words: candesartan, Hyposart, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, sartans, efficacy, safety, generic, arterial hyperten-
sion, chronic heart failure, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
