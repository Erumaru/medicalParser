The article discusses the pathogenesis of pain syndrome in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The literature data and the material of own research are given to show
the prevalence and confirm the importance of polyneuropathy in the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathic pain in this category of patients. Among neuro-
logical disorders in RA, peripheral nervous system damage is detected, for example, sensory or sensory motor axonal neuropathy, demyelinating polyneu-
ropathy, myelopathy, tunnel syndrome. Motor disorders are difficult to diagnose due to existing deformities of joints, limitation of active and passive move-
ments, concomitant muscle atrophy. Thus, it is difficult to assess, if paresis is observed due to articular pathology or peripheral nerve damage.
Complex therapy of the neuropathic pain component (NPC) in RA is carried out with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), basic anti-
inflammatory, glucocorticosteroid and genetically engineered biological therapy (GEBT) aimed at treating the underlying disease, central action drugs (an-
tikonkulsants and antidepressants), and also B group vitamins. In addition to reparative effect on the damaged neurons, acceleration of the regeneration of
peripheral nerves, activation of the synthesis of the myelin sheath of the nerve fiber and transport proteins in axons, these drugs have also an analgesic ef-
fect.
Key words: rheumatoid arthritis, polyneuropathy, B group vitamins, pain syndrome.
