The paper discusses pathogenic aspects of nociceptive pain and the causes of its chronicity. Multimodality of nociceptive pain and its impact on the devel-
opment of muscular dysfunction are uncovered. Underestimation of patient’s personality and inadequate analgesic therapy in acute pains are crucially im-
portant reasons for pain chronicity. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most common medications for nociceptive pain, how-
ever, none of these agents meets the requirements for drug efficacy and safety. Non-selective NSAIDs should be prescribed carefully even in the absence of
typical gastrointestinal disorders since the development of NSAID gastropathy can be dramatic (in several days/weeks). In addition to pharmacological prop-
erties of a medication, patient “selectivity” and personality, pain phenotype specificity, and anamnesis should be considered when prescribing NSAIDs. The
paper reviews the members of various NSAID classes and evaluates their efficacy and safety. Novel NSAID, amtolmetin guacil, combines anti-inflammatory
properties and innovative gastroprotection component resulting from the increased gastric mucosal nitric oxide synthesis.
Key words: nociceptive pain, cyclooxygenase, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, nitric oxide, gastroprotection, amtolmetin guacil.
