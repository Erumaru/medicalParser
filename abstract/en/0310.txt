Low back pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal pain syndromes associated with significant treatment and rehabilitation costs. Low back pain is
also one of the most common causes of temporary disability. The paper summarizes major causes of increasing low back pain occurrence. Many patients do
not receive effective treatment and do not experience pain relief. This results in poor adherence to treatment. The paper analyzes the factors which limit the
doctors to follow recommendations on low back pain treatment. The effects of poor adherence to therapy are devastating. Patient educational programs and
psychotherapy are among the measures to motivate the patients for the treatment. However, their introduction is associated with significant costs and orga-
nizational issues.
Key words: low back pain, adherence to treatment, complications of treatment, educational programs.
