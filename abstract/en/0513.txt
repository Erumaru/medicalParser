OVID, eLIBRARY, LILACS, FDA MAUDE were analyzed on a key word. This review includes works describing the complications of 
vena cava filter implantation, their causes, clinical symptoms, results of surgical, endovascular and conservative treatment. An 
urgency of the problem is shown; types of late complications of vena cava filters implantation, a dependence of the mechanism 
of their development and clinical symptoms on the structure of the implantable device, a length of stay in the vein lumen are 
discussed. Many of the late complications of vena cava filter implantation, such as its thrombosis, syndrome of the inferior 
vena cava, walls damage of the inferior vena cava by elements of the filtering device with their penetration into the adjacent 
anatomical structures, fragmentation of the vena cava filter, filter migration or its fragments in the venous heart and pulmonary 
arteries, with the possible development of myocardial rupture and cardiac tamponade, pose a threat to the patient’s life. In the 
long-term period, the weaknesses of the vena cava filter implantation may dominate their therapeutic role. The article describes 
the  options  for  treatment  tactics  in  the  development  of  complications  of  the  cava  filter  implantation  and  their  results.  The 
necessity of creating a diagnostic and treatment algorithm in this category of patients is substantiated.
Key words: inferior vena cava, vena cava filter, post-thrombotic disease, complication, venous thromboembolic event.
