In recent years, there is a large number of articles devoted to the clinical and economic efficiency study of various generic drug forms. There 
are standard canons of carrying out such researches to which it is necessary to adhere that researches yielded objective results. The article 
deals with the generic drug conceptual definition, and evidence rules of drugs therapeutic equivalence. Error analysis was conducted by 
drawing up design and carrying out research, as well as legal aspects of materials publication were considered during the processing of the 
received results. Studies on the equivalence of various ursodeoxycholic acid generics were used to conduct this analysis. Finally, the detailed 
analysis of the study outcomes, assisted by an internist, a jurist, specialists in medical statistics and pharmaceutical chemistry, was conducted 
considering a specific example.
Keywords: generics, pharmaceutical equivalence, pharmacokinetic equivalence, therapeutic equivalence, ursodesoxycholic acid.
