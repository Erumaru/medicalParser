The review is focused on  the clinical pharmacology of inhaled glucocorticosteroids (IGCS), mechanisms of their action, efficacy and 
peculiarities of clinical use in patients with asthma. These drugs are indicated for the treatment of asthma of varying severity in adults 
and children. They are used as a monotherapy in mild asthma, for the treatment of moderate and severe asthma they are used in a 
combination with long-acting β2-agonists, antileukotriens and long-acting theophyllines. Dosage regimens for the combination of IGCS 
and long-acting β2-agonists are considered. The article provides recommendations for reducing steroid doses when asthma control 
is achieved. The ratio risk/benefit has to be considered when appointing IGCS. Data on possible side effects, factors affecting their 
development and methods of prevention are given. The prospects of clinical use of IGCS in patients with mild asthma are considered. 
Key words: inhaled glucocorticosteroids, efficacy, safety, asthma.
