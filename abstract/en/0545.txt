This article focuses on one of the leading problems of modern medicine - pain and anesthesia. The pathophysiology of the origin of pain and the principles of
the action of anesthetics are examined in detail. The analgesic effect of various drugs results from their effects on different levels of the central nervous sys-
tem. The primary central substrate of the complex interaction of the nociceptive and antinociceptive systems is the posterior horns. This is the place where
the "painful" and "non-painful" sensitivity canals interact, on the basis of which a flow of ascending impulses of a new quality appears.
Capsaicinoids are widely used for local anesthesia, including the treatment of neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain, since they selectively activate Ca2+ -
permeable cationic TRPV1 channels, which are numerously located in the nociceptors’ endings. Numerous studies have shown that a topical application of
capsaicinoid-containing local low-concentration agents is effective enough in the treatment of pain. The article provides the review of the effectiveness of the
use of capsaicinoids and the comparison of natural capsaicin and its synthetic analogue Nonivamide (Capsicam) in the treatment of pain.
Key words: pain, analgesia, capsaicin, nonivamide, Capsicam.
