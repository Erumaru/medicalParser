The paper uncovers the experience with complex antihomotoxic medicines for sports traumas in Russia men's national volleyball team, gold medalists at the
London 2012 Summer Olympics. The specificity of sports injuries in volleyball is determined by specific biomechanics which results in various tendinopathies
affecting active players. Analysis of risk factors prevents sports traumas and allows making changes in trainings together with the coach. The paper ad-
dresses the experience with complex agents for back pains, acute hip muscle injuries, ankle ligament injuries, and tendinopathies in volleyball players. Treat-
ment success depends on early diagnosis, correct drug choice, and early treatment. The author’s experience is that the most common complex homeopathic
medicines are various formulations (i.e., drops, tablets, ointments, and ampules) of Traumeel S, Zeel T, Lymphomyosot, Coenzyme compositum, Discus com-
positum, and Spascupreel. Some of these agents are administered via biopuncture. In some cases, monotherapy or combinations of several medicines result
in reduced pain and rehabilitation terms as well as early return to training and competitions. In other cases, additional pharmacotherapy, physiotherapy
(magnetic therapy, phonophoresis, laser therapy, shockwave therapy, Tecar therapy), and medical exercises are required.
