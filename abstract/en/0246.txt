The article describes one of the most urgent uronephrologic problems in children - overactive bladder (OAB). Currently new methods of etiological and
pathogenetic OAB treatment are under active search. One option is the possibility of correcting cell bioenergetic processes. So far necessary attention has
not been given to the study of carnitine and its compounds level in children with OAB. Authors presents results of own research of cellular bioenergetics state
in children with OAB, evaluating both level of mitochondrial enzymes, and carnitine metabolism. Relationship between degree of cell bioenergetics violation
and severity of clinical manifestations is established, as well as the role of energotropic therapy in OAB treatment is demonstrated. The trial showed that L-
carnitine reduces the severity of clinical manifestations and improves functional state of the bladder in children with overactive bladder.
Key words: children, overactive bladder, bladder dysfunction, energotropic therapy, L-carnitine, Elcar.
