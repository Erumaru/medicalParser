Psoriasis is one of the most common chronic severe skin diseases. According to S.K. Kurd, J.M. Gelfand (2009), about 3.5% of 
the world’s population suffers from psoriasis. According to the Ministry of Health in the Russian Federation in 2017, a total of 
346,978 patients with psoriasis were registered, which corresponds to 236.4 cases per 100 thousand of the population.
The article presents the latest statistical data on the incidence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the Russian Federation — 
the current information on the pathogenesis and genetic engineering biological therapy of psoriasis is reviewed. The clinical 
case of effective treatment with secukinumab of an elderly patient with common severe psoriasis vulgaris is presented.
The presented clinical case demonstrates the high clinical efficacy of the drug Cosentyx (secukinumab) in the treatment of severe 
psoriasis vulgaris. A quick and stable result was achieved — a decrease in the PASI index by 97% over 12 weeks. An elderly 
patient with the presence of comorbidities, as well as poor tolerability of basic therapy with methotrexate, had well­tolerated 
secukinumab treatment, no adverse events were detected during 12 weeks of therapy, which confirms such characteristics of the 
drug as safety, high efficacy and no adverse effects.
Key words: common psoriasis vulgaris, psoriatic arthritis, genetically engineered biological therapy, secukinumab, Cosentyx.
