Aim: to study the association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs556621 (G > T) and stroke in patients with cardiovascular 
disorders and its risk factors in Eastern Siberian population.
Patients and Methods: 260 patients with stroke aged 51–62 (mean age 57 years; 157 men and 103 women) and 272 healthy individuals aged 
51–62 (mean age 55 years; 170 men and 102 women) were enrolled in the study. Complaints and history taking, clinical examination, brain 
CT, electrocardiography, echocardioscopy, duplex ultrasound of extracranial brachiocephalic arteries (EBA), 24-hour blood pressure and 
heart rate monitoring, and coagulation tests were performed in the study group. Arterial hypertension, paroxysmal supraventricular tachy-
cardia, dyslipidemia, EBA atherosclerosis, and hemostatic disorders were diagnosed in the study group. Controls were examined according 
to the HAPIEE study protocol. Molecular genetic studies were performed using real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using Sta-
tistica for Windows 7.0, Excel, and SPSS 22 software. The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) principles 
and the Declaration of Helsinki.

Results: No significant associations between rs11196288 (A > G) gene and allele polymorphism and stroke were revealed in either group 
or  subgroup  (patients  with  arterial  hypertension,  upraventricular  tachycardia,  EBA  atherosclerosis,  dyslipidemia,  or  hypercoagulation).  
No gender differences in the distributions of polymorphism genes and alleles were identified as well.
Conclusions: rs11196288 (A > G) SNP does not provide any significant effect on stroke in Eastern Siberian population despite pre-existing 
cardiovascular disorders and risk factors.
Keywords: stroke, supraventricular tachycardia, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, hemostasis, rs11196288.
