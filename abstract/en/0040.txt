acute period. The detailed information is given about the pronator tunnel syndrome, the anterior interosseous nerve syndrome, carpel tunnel syndrome, the
Guyon tunnel syndrome and cubital tunnel syndrome. The author presents her own data on the frequency of occurrence of various tunnel syndromes of the
upper limbs among 68 patients. There are also the results of examination of 60 patients with electrophysiological and clinical criteria of the newly diagnosed
neuropathy of the median nerves at the level of the carpal canal without a direct trauma of the upper limbs in the history, the main clinical manifestations of
this pathology, general and local risk factors of their development. The main types of treatment are described. The treatment of tunnel syndromes is based
on conservative therapy, the purpose of which is the decompression of the nerve trunk and restoration of its functions. The first and fundamentally important
task for the doctor is the fastest and most effective relief of pain. The drugs of choice in this case are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as the
well-proven nimesulide (Nise®).
