Inflammatory diseases of the nose, rhinitis, are one of the most common disorders of the upper airways. While the symptoms of acute rhinitis which accom-
panies almost every episode of viral respiratory infection rapidly regress, clinical signs of chronic rhinitis (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea) significantly reduce
patients’ quality of life.
Allergic rhinitis is one the most common types of chronic rhinitis. Antihistamines are widely used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Azelastine nasal spray
is a second-generation antihistamine which is indicated for the treatment of allergic and non-allergic rhinitis both in adults and children. It is characterized
by rapid onset of action (15 min) and the capability of dosage (1 or 2 sprays in each nostril twice a day) and regimen (on permanent or as-needed basis) ad-
justment. The paper summarizes the results of clinical studies which compare azelastine and other drugs used to treat allergic rhinitis as well as the results
of safety studies.
Key words: allergic rhinitis, azelastive nasal spray, non-allergic rhinitis.
