In recent years, silver­based drugs are rarely used in the treatment of various forms of rhinitis. Review of foreign scientific 
studies over the past years indicates the return of preparations with silver ions to the pharmaceutical market and the prospects 
for their application in various branches of medicine. Review on scientific studies on the biological effects of silver ions has 
been carried out, and modern ideas on the mechanisms of action on bacterial cells have been described. The article digs into 
the question of the safety of silver in medicine. Antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal effects of drugs with silver are proven. 
Besides, it has been established that silver ions have the ability to potentiate the action of a number of antibiotics, increasing 
their activity, against microorganisms with polyvalent resistance as well. In connection with the growth of antibiotic resistance 
of microorganisms and the lack of prerequisites for the emergence of new antibiotics in the coming decades, preparations with 
silver ions can be used topically in combination with antibiotics to increase the spectrum of their antimicrobial activity. Due to 
the wide range of the biological action of silver ions, the use of drugs based on it (e.g., the drug Sialor®) is justified both in viral 
and in bacterial forms of rhinitis.
Key words: rhinitis, antibacterial activity, antibiotics synergism, silver ions, silver proteinate, Sialor®.
