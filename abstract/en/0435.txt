Wolff-Parkinsov-White syndrome - pre-excitation of the ventricles of the heart, passing along an additional conducting path, causing various disturbances
of the heart rhythm. The manifestation of this pathology is more common in childhood, than in the adult. In most cases, the first manifestation of WPW syn-
drome occurs at a young age (10 to 20 years). Especially important is that the probability of a sudden cardiac death ranges from 0.15 to 0.39%, which is above
the general population risk (less than 0.1%). This disease has different forms of manifestation: from persistent clinical and electrophysiological manifesta-
tions in the overt form, to the absence of any subjective and objective symptoms in a latent form. The onset of the Wolff-Parkinson-white syndrome also varies
from a mild tachycardia, to life-threatening arrhythmias. It makes important the early diagnosis and monitoring of these patients. Today scientists pay more
attention to the genetic aspects of various cardiovascular diseases, including WPW syndrome, that has been used successfully in the prediction and diag-
nostics of latent forms of the disease. The article presents a brief review of literature on Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: definition, classification, "gold
standards" in diagnosis, treatment, as well as genetic aspects.
Key words: Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, WPW, ventricular pre-excitation, arrhythmia.
