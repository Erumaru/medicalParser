Stable drug provision for patients with socially significant diseases as part of the program of state guarantees of free medical 
care to citizens, as well as a part of state social assistance in the form of a set of social services, is one of the domestic health 
care  priorities.  Chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  and  asthma  are  a  significant  burden  for  society  due  to  the 
continuously  increasing  disease  incidence,  the  need  for  continuous  lifelong  therapy  with  expensive  drugs  and,  at  the  same 
time, not the highest adherence of patients to treatment. One of the ways to increase the availability and effectiveness of drug 
provision for patients with asthma and COPD, as well as adherence to therapy, is the implementation of the import phase-out 
program. The key requirements for reproduced drugs are quality, safety, good tolerability, the availability of optimal devices 
for inhalation delivery, ease of use, low cost. Such requirements are met by the domestic manufacturer of medicines «Nativa». 
Successful implementation of the import phase-out program in the production of a full cycle of domestic medicines will allow us 
to confidently implement all key destinations of drug provision for all patients in need.
Key words: bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, drug supply, import phase-out, Nativa.
