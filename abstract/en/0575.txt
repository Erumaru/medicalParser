The review discusses neurological disorders in chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Special attention is paid to the mechanisms of their occurrence.
It is emphasized that the most frequently detected disorders are those of the peripheral nervous system. Central nervous system disorders occur much less
frequently in patients with HCV. The occurrence of neurological disorders is often seen in patients with cryoglobulinemia. The leading manifestation of
polyneuropathy in patients with HCV is sensory impairment. Clinical symptoms of the polyneuropathy are mainly caused by the lesion of axons, but other
mechanisms are discussed in the pathogenesis of the peripheral nervous system disorders (mononeuropathy, multiple mononeuropathy, etc.). Central neu-
rological disorders are associated with lesions of the white matter, including, and due to a stroke and 50% of the patients revealed neurocognitive disorder.
One of the most frequent manifestations of the impairment of the central nervous system by chronic HCV infection is depression and on the background of
specific therapy its intensity can increase. Among cognitive disorders, a special role is attached to violations of regulatory functions. Interferon-alpha in
combination with ribavirin and telaprevir remains a treatment option for chronic HCV infection.
Key words: hepatitis C virus infection, neurologic complications, pathogenesis, diagnosis, therapy.
