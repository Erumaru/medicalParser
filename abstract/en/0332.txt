Unreasonable prescription of systemic antibacterial drugs in the treatment of infectious and inflammatory diseases of the upper 
respiratory tract leads to increased levels of antibiotic resistance. In the overwhelming majority of cases, systemic antibacterial 
therapy for acute rhinosinusitis is not indicated, since acute rhinosinusitis is viral in 90% of cases. In chronic rhinosinusitis, 
the  prescription  of  systemic  antibiotic  therapy  should  be  strictly  justified.  An  alternative  to  the  systemic  administration  of 
antibiotics for rhinosinusitis is topical antimicrobial application. The combination drug Fluimucil®­antibiotic IT, which includes 
the  N­acetylcysteine  mucolytic  and  thiamphenicol,  broad­spectrum  antibiotic,  is  highly  effective  in  treating  inflammatory 
diseases of the upper respiratory tract. The use of the drug Fluimucil®­antibiotic IT for rhinosinusitis allows you to accelerate 
the onset of convalescence, to avoid systemic antibiotic therapy and invasive procedures.
Key  words:  rhinosinusitis,  inhalation  therapy,  topical  therapy,  antibiotic  therapy,  thiamphenicol  glycinate  acetylcysteine, 
Fluimucil®­antibiotic IT.
