The article highlights the issues of definition, epidemiology, etiology, classification, clinical picture, diagnosis and treatment of adenoid vegetations, acute
and exacerbations of chronic adenoiditis in children. It presents a literature review and the results of clinical studies investigating the role of pathogens in
etiology of chronic adenoiditis in children. The article presents the own  results of studying the effectiveness of the use of a topical antiseptic - an industrial
silver proteinate in the treatment of 64 children with chronic adenoiditis caused by fungal-bacterial associations. The article also presents the results of own
experimental work on studying in vitro effect of silver proteinate on polyresistant strain of Candida tropicalis, isolated from a child with a fungal adenoiditis.
It is proved that a marked antimycotic action of silver proteinate is retained even in the minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.1%, which determins the fea-
sibility of its use in children with fungal adenoiditis. It is noted that industrial Proteinate of silver in the form of droplets is effective for topical application in
the treatment of acute and exacerbation of chronic adenoiditis of various etiology in different age periods and can be recommended for use in pediatric ENT
practice.
Key words: children, adenoids, acute adenoiditis, chronic adenoiditis, fungal-bacterial associations, microbiocenosis of nasopharynx, proteinate of silver.
