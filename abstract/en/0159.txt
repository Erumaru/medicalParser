An amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition in the organs and tissues of a particular protein of the 
amyloid fibrillar structure. The clinical picture of amyloidosis is diverse, the clinic depends on the involvement of a particular 
organ in the pathological process, and the determining factor in the choice of treatment tactics is to establish the cause of 
its  development.  The  article  presents  a  clinical  case  of  amyloidosis  associated  with  multiple  myeloma.  The  features  of  this 
clinical case are presented as an initially uncertified nosological form of heart disease with the leading syndrome of cardiac 
insufficiency, a relapsing course of pleurisy and an absence of kidney damage under conditions of proven amyloidosis. Diagnosis 
of secondary AL-amyloidosis in multiple myeloma is challenging and is based on histological and immunohistochemical studies 
of the bone marrow, secretion of Bens-Jones λ-protein. The most effective treatment method in young patients is the protocols 
for the therapy of multiple myeloma (VCD courses) for patients-candidates for autologous transplantation of hematopoietic 
stem cells (auto-THSC) with its subsequent implementation.
Key words: AL-amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, heart disease in amyloidosis, cardiac insufficiency.
