Iron deficiency disorders (IDD) are the most common deficiency conditions in the human population, most common in children 
and women of reproductive age. Depending on the degree of severity of iron deficiency in the body, the latent iron deficiency 
state (LID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are identified. The clinical manifestations of IDD are non-specific, and therefore 
their  diagnosis  is  based  on  the  identification  of  characteristic  laboratory  changes,  which  include:  a  decrease  in  the  serum 
concentration of iron, ferritin and a decrease in the saturation index of transferrin by iron. In this case, if these laboratory 
markers are detected at a normal level of hemoglobin, the LID is diagnosed. In the same cases, when hypochromic, microcytic 
anemia takes place simultaneously with laboratory signs of iron deficiency (the criteria of which are reduction of hemoglobin 
concentration, decrease in the values of «blood color indices» and average volume of erythrocytes), the IDA diagnosed. At the 
same time, irrespective of the form of iron deficiency, the main method of therapy is the use of iron preparations. The choice of 
specific iron-containing drugs, as well as the way they are administered, the duration of the course of treatment and the dosage 
regimen depend on the initial degree of severity of iron deficiency, the age of the child and the state of the health in general.
Key words: anemia, children, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, latent iron deficiency.
