The article presents information on the terminology of vegetative disorders. It shows the expediency of using the term «syndrome 
of vegetative dystonia», which is a complex of symptoms caused by violation of autonomic regulation of all organs and systems 
of the organism, metabolic processes as a result of primary or secondary morphofunctional changes in the suprasegmentary 
and / or segmental structures of the autonomic nervous system, combined with psychoemotional disorders. The pathogenesis of 
vegetative disorders is considered from the viewpoint of alternative interaction of the processes forming adaptive-compensatory 
reactions in the body. It is demonstrated that the pathogenesis of the syndrome of vegetative dystonia is caused by the imbalance 
between  the  sympathetic  and  parasympathetic  regulation  of  the  organs  and  systems  of  the  organism,  connected  with  the 
disintegration of the higher vegetative centers. The mechanisms of action of energotropic drugs (L-carnitine and coenzyme 
Q10) are described in detail, information on the effectiveness of their use for various manifestations of vegetative disorders is 
presented. Data from the literature indicate a pronounced energotropic and vegetotropic action of these drugs. The discussed 
drugs are systemic drugs, which corresponds to the systemic nature of autonomic regulation. The positive effect of their action 
is associated, first of all, with their participation in the energy supply of all organs and systems of the body.
Key words: children, vegetative dystonia, L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, alternative interaction.
