Polyneuropathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders with different etiology and pathogenesis which share a common feature – multiple diffuse lesions
of nerve fibers of peripheral nerves. Polyneuropathy is a clinical condition manifested with motor, sensory, and vegetative symptoms which result from the
damage of certain fiber type. Currently, the occurrence of polyneuropathy is rather high. Considering the heterogeneity of pathogenic and clinical variants,
this disorder is an important issue. The most common types are diabetic and alcoholic neuropathy. Treatment approach requires the analysis of clinical man-
ifestations, etiological factors, and patient’s individuality. Various additional medicines are recommended for the complications of diabetic and alcoholic
neuropathy. Symptomatic (anticonvulsants, selective serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), pathogenic (alpha lipoic
acid, B vitamins), or combined therapy is prescribed. The paper summarizes data on the pathogenesis, clinical neurological signs of diabetic and alcoholic
neuropathy, and their complex treatment. Symptomatic and pathogenic therapy improves both treatment efficacy and clinical status.
Key words: diabetic polyneuropathy, alcoholic polyneuropathy, alpha lipoic acid, gabapentin, complex B vitamins).
