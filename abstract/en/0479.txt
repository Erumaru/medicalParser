Complaints  of  the  arm,  neck  and/or  shoulder  (CANS)  is  an  important  medical,  social,  and  economic  issue  due  to  its  high  prevalence 
among  working  age  population.  The  paper  addresses  pathogenic  aspects  and  classification  approach  to  CANS  diagnosis.  Currently, 
alternative  treatment  strategies  for  pain  relief  gain  popularity  since  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  mainly  used  to  treat  pain 
provoke multiple adverse reactions. Symptomatic slow acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SYSADOA) are amongst alternative therapeutic 
agents prescribed early for pain management. Multifaceted biological activity of this drugs has chondroprotective, anti-inflammatory, 
analgesic and regenerative effects. The implementation of these effects provides a basis for their appointment as an alternative therapy 
for pain syndromes in patients with rheumatological and neurological profiles. The representative of this group is Alflutop demonstrated 
safety and efficacy in the treatment of CANS.
