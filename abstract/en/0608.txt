To translate literally, paraneoplastic syndrome is a syndrome that accompanies malignant tumor. However, published data suggest that paraneoplastic syn-
drome is directly induced by the tumor but not accompanies it. In a number of cases, paraneoplastic syndrome can be the first clinical manifestation of the
tumor. Sometimes, the nature of paraneoplastic syndrome may suggest the localization of the tumor since certain types of malignant tumors are associated
with specific skin lesions. Keratodermas commonly occur in elderly patients. Some of these conditions are considered as paraneoplastic syndromes. Parane-
oplastic keratodermas belong to a group of paraneoplastic skin disorders. The paper reviews current data on epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, and clas-
sification of these conditions. Clinical manifestations of common paraneoplastic dermatoses as well as differential diagnostic aspects are discussed. Clinical
case describes a woman with Leser-Trelat sign and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. The diagnosis of the malignant tumor was
provided by diagnostic tests which were performed to identify the nature of skin lesions.
Key words: paraneoplastic keratoderma, sign of Leser-Trelat, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon.
