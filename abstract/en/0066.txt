The article reviews the literature on modern views on the pathogenesis, clinical picture and pathogenetic therapy of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). The
pathogenetic role of the destabilization of the microbiocenosis system in the development of diarrheal syndrome is shown. The results of the studies of risk of
AAD development are presented. The aspects of pathogenetic therapy aimed at optimizing the parameters of the microbiocenosis are described in detail. A
promising area in the therapeutic correction of microbiocenosis disorders is the metabiotic drugs (Hylak forte) that are structural components of probiotic mi-
croorganisms and / or their metabolites and / or signaling molecules with a known chemical structure that can optimize the main specific physiological func-
tions, associated with the activity of the macroorganism and its microflora. The effectiveness and safety profile of metabiotic therapy has been examined in ex-
perimental studies and clinical practice. A metabiotic drug is Hylak forte. The complex composition of this drug provides a wide therapeutic effect on the gas-
trointestinal microbiocenosis. Hylak forte is recommended for patients with established disorders of microbiocenosis of the small and large intestine with AAD
or during antibiotic treatment.
Key words: antibiotic-associated diarrhea, antibacterial drugs, probiotics, metabiotics, Hylak forte.
