Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune multi-systemic disease that can affect such vital organs as the kidneys 
and the brain. Although the survival rate of SLE patients has dramatically improved over the past few decades as a result of the 
use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, the current treatment is associated with significant adverse effects. Both the 
disease itself and the side effects from treatment are associated with cumulative organ damage, which reduces both the quality 
and expectancy of patients’ life. The international expert group on treat-to-target in SLE has formulated recommendations with 
the goals to yield superior outcomes in terms of clinical course, long-term damage and functional status. The working group 
established four overarching principles for managing SLE patients, emphasizing the importance of contribution of the patient in 
the decision making, the multidisciplinary approach, the regular monitoring and adjustment of therapy with the goals towards 
ensuring long-term survival, preventing organ damage, optimising health-related quality of life by controlling disease activity, 
minimising comorbidities and drug toxicity.
Key words: systemic lupus erythematosus, treatment, remission, activity, quality of life.
