The article discusses topical issues of arterial blood pressure control and improving patient’s compliance to adequate therapy to achieve target BP levels. The
review analyzes the advantages of the M3 Comfort tonometer with Intelli Wrap cuff, the unique design of which provides a 360 degree accuracy of mea-
surement. The Intelli Wrap provides sufficient shoulder coverage with a circumference of 22 to 42 cm, it is specifically designed to distribute pressure uni-
formly around the shoulder to minimize the effect of the wrong cuff position. The article presents the results of studies on the use of the M3 Comfort tonome-
ter with the Intelli Wrap. It is shown that when using this multifunctional cuff with an oscillometric device, its incorrect location towards the brachial artery
does not affect the accuracy of measurements even in persons with a very large circumference of the shoulder. The article also highlights the use of the M3
Comfort tonometer (OMRON) in AH during pregnancy and postpartum period with high accuracy of automatic oscillometric measurements of blood pres-
sure at the level of the brachial artery in pregnant women, including those with pre-eclampsia.
