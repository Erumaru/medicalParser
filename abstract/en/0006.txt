Summary
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common and severe chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases which result in early disability and high
early mortality. Early diagnosis and active treatment of RA can improve prognosis and outcomes. The paper reviews clinical situations and management
strategies of RA at different stages of the disease (i.e., early, advanced, and late), treatment algorithms, and approaches to prevent osteoporotic fractures,
cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal complications in elderly patients. The main goal of RA therapy is to achieve remission or, at least, low disease activity.
Treatment approach depends on RA stage, disease activity, factors associated with unfavorable outcome, comorbidities, and the efficacy of prior treatment.
Basic therapy is the most effective in early RA. Treat-to-target approach recommends careful monitoring of RA activity (every month in high disease activi-
ty and every 3 months in low disease activity) and proper correction of basic therapy. In low efficacy of standard therapy with basic anti-inflammatory drugs,
bioengineered drugs are recommended.
Keywords: rheumatoid arthritis, diagnostics, treatment approaches, osteoporosis, fractures, NSAID gastropathy.
