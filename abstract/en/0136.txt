The article deals with the issues of different equivalence types of generic drugs and with the evidence of the original and generic product 
therapeutic effectiveness as well. The authors compared several currently existing definitions of «therapeutic equivalence». This article lists 
the qualitative generic features.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is one of the drugs that demonstrate adequate quality in generic forms. This bile acid is found in bear bile in large 
amounts, as well as in human bile in small amounts. UDCA production and market, drug substance pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
issues, the study results on the UDCA effectiveness and safety in patients with biliary sludge are described by the authors. The studied UDCA 
preparations showed a very high similarity of more than 99% during infrared spectrography and high-performance liquid chromatography. The 
data obtained indicated almost identical pharmaceutical equivalence of all the drugs described in this article. These drugs have demonstrated 
full pharmaceutical equivalence, thus, this implies their pharmacokinetic and therapeutic equivalence. A detailed analysis of the study results 
was carried out with the participation of an internist, a lawyer and a specialist in pharmaceutical chemistry.
Keywords: generics, pharmaceutical equivalence, pharmacokinetic equivalence, therapeutic equivalence, ursodesoxycholic acid.
