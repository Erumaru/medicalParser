Sleep is a periodically arising condition, subject to circadian rhythm and manifested by a change in brain activity and reaction to stimuli. Sleep is an impor-
tant component of the full life of every person, and its quantity and quality largely determine the state of health. There are mutual influences between sleep
and metabolic disorders. The article presents the mechanisms explaining the influence of sleep deprivation and the displacement of circadian rhythms on
metabolic dysregulation and causing a metabolic disorder. These changes can be multifactorial and lead to cardiovascular disorders due to excessive sym-
pathetic stimulation, hormonal imbalance and subclinical inflammation. In turn, metabolic imbalance can lead to various sleep disorders. Thus, doctors in
their clinical practice need to be attentive to both the quality and the quantity of patients' sleep, because timely correction of sleep disorders can significant-
ly reduce the risk of metabolic disorders and their complications.
Key words: sleep, sleep deprivation, circadian rhythms, metabolic disorders, hormone level, sleep-disordered breathing.
