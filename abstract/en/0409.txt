Sacroiliac (SI) joint is a unique joint being partly typical synovial joint and partly immovable cartilaginous synostosis. 15-30% of nonspecific back pains are SI
joint pains. They are more common in elderly persons and younger sportsmen. The examination reveals unilateral low back pain without any signs of radicu-
lopathy. Three or more positive results of challenge tests are likely to diagnose SI joint pain. However, diagnostic blockades under X-ray control are the gold stan-
dard for SI joint pain. International guidelines on the management of acute and chronic nonspecific back pains address common treatment strategies. Multimodal
approach should be preferred. The treatment of SI joint pain should be prescribed individually based on the diagnostic test results and patient selection. Consid-
ering pathogenic role of degenerative and dystrophic disorders, chondroprotectors should be included into the complex treatment of low back pains. The combi-
nation of glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate (Teraflex) is useful for the treatment and prevention of degenerative and dystrophic joint disorders.
Intra- and extraarticular steroids might provide only moderate effect. If the treatment is ineffective, radio-frequency destruction is recommended.
Key words: nonspecific back pain, sacroiliac joint, blockades, radio-frequency destruction, Teraflex.
