Peripheral nervous system lesions are caused by a wide heterogeneous group of diseases. The most frequent clinical manifestations 
of  them  are  peripheral  paresis  and  pain  syndromes.  Adequate  choice  of  drugs  and  non-drug  treatment  can  achieve  sufficient 
effectiveness in treatment of patients with peripheral nervous system diseases. One of directions of the treatment of such patients is use 
of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI), and Axamon (ipidacrine) is a representative of this class of drugs. It has a stimulating effect 
on neuromuscular transmission and conduction of excitation through nerve fibers due to inhibition of AChEI activity and potassium 
channel blockade, which causes an elongation of the excitation period in a presynaptic fiber during a passage of nerve impulse and 
allows a large amount of acetylcholine to escape into a synaptic cleft. Due to inhibition of sodium channel activity, the use of drug 
provides a moderate analgesic effect. Possibilities of using the drug Axamon (ipidacrine) in mono- and polyneuropathies mainly with 
motor disorders — peripheral paresis, treatment of patients with facial nerve neuropathy are considered.
Key words: peripheral nervous system, peripheral paresis, nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain syndrome, treatment, ipidacrine, 
Axamon.
