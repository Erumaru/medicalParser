According to the World Health Organization estimates, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) will be ranked number one 
in the liver diseases pattern by 2020. Liver transplantation in patients with cirrhosis as the outcome of NAFLD currently ranks 
next to the viral liver cirrhosis.
According  to  current  concepts,  NAFLD  is  a  liver  disease  defined  as  fatty  dystrophy,  fatty  degeneration  with  inflammation 
and possible outcome in cirrhosis. The causal relationship between NAFLD and diabetes mellitus is the subject of numerous 
discussions. Insulin resistance is the binding pathogenetic link between these diseases. First of all, insulin resistance is carried 
out at the level of hepatocyte. Until now, there is no standard therapy for NAFLD. Correction of body weight, changes in food 
addiction, physical activity are the most effective measures to prevent the development of NAFLD and diabetes mellitus. None of 
the drugs used for the treatment of NAFLD has evidence base for the effect on the histological pattern of NAFLD.
Key words: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, complex medication, taurine.
