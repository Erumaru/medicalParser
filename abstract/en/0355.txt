The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the world has been growing steadily, surpassing the most pessimistic forecasts of our century, moreover, a «re-
juvenation» of type 2 diabetes has been observed everywhere. As a result of the set of pathological processes occurring in the diabetes, a variety of lesions of
most organs and body systems is formed. The «classic» complications of diabetes include nephropathy, retinopathy, and the distal symmetrical sensory-
motor polyneuropathy (DPN), which is most frequently diagnosed in patients with DM. DPN is often seen in the endocrinological and neurological clinical
practice, it develops slowly, it has a subclinical phase and can be a manifestation of type 2 diabetes. A great number of patients do not complain even when
there are large lesions of peripheral nerves, and their neuropathy can be detected only during neurological and electrophysiological examinations. Methods
of early diagnosis of lesions of peripheral nerves in diabetes can help to prevent the development of the most severe complications, and to assign a patho-
genetic treatment as early as possible.
