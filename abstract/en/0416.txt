Heartburn is one of the most common somatic symptoms. In the Russian Federation it occurs in 40% of people aged from18 to 59 years and in 30% of the pop-
ulation over the age of 60. The article examines in detail the pathophysiology of heartburn in patients with reflux esophagitis (RE) and non-erosive reflux dis-
ease (NERD), in which pathological conditions such as hypersensitive esophagus (HE) or functional heartburn (PH) can be detected. The microscopic study
of the mucosa of the distal esophagus is used to diagnose and distinguish between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and HE from PH. To diagnose the
causes of heartburn, FGDS and daily pH-impedance measurements are made. According to the Roman criteria, the IV group of functional disorders of the
esophagus includes: functional pain in the chest, FI, HE, globus pharyngeus and functional dysphagia. 
In patients with RE, NERD, HE the acid-suppressive therapy is highly effective, especially when using the modern PPIs. A peculiarity of the PPI of dexlanso-
prazole is the dextrorotatory isomer that is more favorable from the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic point of view. However, in patients with PH the
PPIs can be ineffective, in this case it is necessary to give preference to the drugs that reduce visceral hypersensitivity.
Key words: heartburn, GERD, reflux esophagitis, hypersensitive esophagus, PPI, dexlansoprazole.
