Diabetic neuropathy characterized by nerve fiber lesions as a result of metabolic, vascular, and other disorders is one of the most common diabetes compli-
cations. The paper addresses classification of diabetic neuropathy, its diagnosis and stages. Differential diagnostic aspects of diabetic neuropathy and oth-
er neuropathies (i.e., alcoholic, toxic, inflammatory etc.) are discussed. The paper highlights the importance of detailed examination to diagnose polyneu-
ropathy (subjective signs, careful neurological examination, quantitative sensory testing, vegetative tests, electrophysiology, and other instrumental tests).
The aim of pathogenic therapy of diabetic neuropathy is to restore the functions of damaged nerves while the aim of symptomatic therapy is to reduce pain.
The paper uncovers potential modalities for medical (the effects of first-, second-, and third-choice medications and their combinations are discussed) and
non-medical treatment. Step-by-step algorithm to reduce neuropathic pain is described. The mechanism of action of antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs
as well as monotherapy variants depending on the manifestations of diabetic neuropathy are detailed.
Key words: diabetes, neuropathy, asymmetric proximal neuropathy, distal polyneuropathy.
