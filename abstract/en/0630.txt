The aim of intraoperative neuromonitoring in patients undergoing spinal surgical procedures is to reduce the rate of postoperative neurological complica-
tions. Published data demonstrate that complex use and combination of various techniques allow to reveal significant changes in spinal cord functioning and
to prevent its injury in the course of the surgery or in secondary complications. Neuromonitoring identifies nervous system structures and assesses the in-
tegrity and the damage of spinal conduction pathways by registering somatosensory evoked potentials and transcranial motor evoked potentials. The paper
addressess the history of the technique, major principles and methods of intraoperative neuromonitoring. Neurophysiological «alarm signals» indicate the ab-
normalities of functional integrity of spinal conduction pathways. Published data on the efficacy and safety of various techniques of intraoperative neu-
romonitoring depending on the surgical procedure, spinal injury level, anamnestic neuromuscular disorders, and the severity of neurological deficiency are
summarized. Potential application of intraoperative neuromonitoring for scoliosis surgery is discussed.
Key words: multimodal intraoperative neuromonitoring, somatosensory evoked potentials, motor evoked potentials, spinal disorders and injuries, spinal
surgery.
