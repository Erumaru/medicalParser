Nonspecific lower back pain (LBP) is a frequent pathological condition that adversely affects the patient's quality of life and performance. The correct diag-
nostic approach and treatment provides a favorable prognosis for the most of patients. Chronic LBP lasts more than 12 weeks, the predictors of the condition
may be the presence of concomitant specific psychological diseases, inorganic symptoms, a high level of functional impairment and poor overall health. The
algorithm for the correction of pain syndrome (PS) consists in the consistent use of analgesics according to the «pain treatment ladder» of WHO. Paracetamol
and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the form of monotherapy can be used in the first stage. Studies have shown that a combination of
NSAIDs and paracetamol has the best analgesic effect compared to the effect of using the drugs separately. A combination drug with a fixed dose of ibuprofen
/ paracetamol (200/500 mg) showed greater efficacy, a faster onset of action, a longer duration of the effect compared to that of standard ibuprofen and
paracetamol. In severe pain syndrome, it is recommended to use a double single dose. In case of ineffectiveness of the first anesthesia stage, soft opioids are
added to the therapy.
