Summary
The paper reviews the outcomes of clinical use of bioregulator Traumeel® S in patients with acute and subacute disorders of musculoskeletal system, includ-
ing traumas and athletic injuries. The formulation of Traumeel® contains 12 plant ingredients and 2 mineral ingredients at low concentrations. It provides
analgesic, anti-edema, and anti-exudative action. Traumeel® rapidly reduces inflammation and pain, resolves hemorrhages, and promotes recovery. The da-
ta on the clinical use of Traumeel® are summarized. While being not inferior to NSAIDs, this drug is better tolerated by the patients and can be considered as
an alternative to conventional NSAIDs.
The search was performed in AMED, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for articles on Traumeel® use. The author analyzed all clinical stud-
ies of Traumeel® and/or its components beginning from 1966. These studies included data on treatment efficacy, side effects (clinical and laboratory para-
meters were evaluated), and mechanisms of action of this agent.
The data on the efficacy and safety of Traumeel® S, its components, placebo, and active control are reviewed in the context of current immunological termi-
nology.
