Aim: to determine the main advantages of the mini-percutaneous nephro-lithotripsy (mini-PNL) method in pediatric patients 
with urolithiasis, according to the standard evaluation criteria for this method.
Patients and Methods: 74 children aged from 1 year to 16 years with urolithiasis were enrolled in the study. The mean age  
of the patients operated with mini-PNL was 7.5 years. The study involved 51 (68.9%) boys and 23 (31.1%) girls. The results  
of treatment of patients after mini-PNL were compared with the results of 80 children who were operated with a standard 
PNL. The duration of the operation and hospitalization, possible complications and the effectiveness of the surgery (residual 
stones) were evaluated.
Results:  in  the  mini-PNL  group,  complete  removal  from  stones  was  observed  in  90.5%  of  cases  (in  67  of  74  patients), 
whereas after standard PNL the total removal was 86.2%. 3 patients (4%) required the repeated percutaneous surgery 
after mini PNL and 11 patients (13.7%) — after standard PNL. In the remaining 4 (5.4%) patients, residual stones were 
fragmented  by  remote  shock  wave  lithotripsy.  The  duration  of  mini-PNL  ranged  from  30  to  150  minutes,  the  average 
duration was 45.5 minutes, which is comparable to standard PNL with the duration of 42.7 minutes. The average duration 
of stay in the clinic was 2.58 days (duration range 1—8 days). The main reason for the increase in bed-days was episodes 
of hyperthermia in the postoperative period. Blood transfusion was not required for any child both during the operation 
and in the postoperative period.
Conclusion:  mini-PNL  is  effective  (90.5%)  for  treating  nephrolithiasis  in  children.  This  is  a  minimally  invasive  method  for 
treating kidney stones with minimal possible kidney trauma.
