According to the current guidance documents, therapy of viral and post-viral acute rhinosinusitis can be limited by symptomatic treatment, i.e., non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, plant drugs, decongestants, nasal irrigation with isotonic solution, and, in acute post-viral rhinosinusitis, anti-inflammatory drugs
(intranasal corticosteroids). Although early inflammation of the paranasal sinuses generally has viral etiology, associated bacterial infection exacerbates the
disease thus requiring the addition of antibacterial therapy to the regimen. Protected penicillins, macrolides, and respiratory fluoroquinolones are the first
choice of etiological oral treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Reducing and mucolytic agents should be prescribed as additional therapy. If bacteri-
al etiology of acute rhinosinusitis is confirmed, antimicrobial treatment should be started as early as possible since expectant management in these cases is
associated with a risk of intraorbital and intracranial rhinogenous complications as well as prolonged course of the disease and high risk of its recurrences
and chronicity.
Key words: acute rhinosinusitis, guidance documents, antibacterial therapy.
