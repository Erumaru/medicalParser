Aim. To summarize clinical experience and to assess the outcomes of the suturing of perforated pyloroduodenal ulcer using running two-level technique.
Patients and methods. 159 patients who underwent surgery for perforated pyloroduodenal ulcer (2009−2016) were enrolled in the study. Study group in-
cluded 79 patients who underwent the suturing of the ulcer using running two-level technique without capturing the mucosa. Control group included 80 pa-
tients who underwent the suturing of the ulcer using classic two-row technique. Endoscopy was performed after 9 or 10 days and after 3 to 72 months.
Results. Fibrogastroduodenoscopy performed at day 10 after the surgery revealed significant differences in ulcer healing rate. Red scars were identified in
41 study group patients (52%) and 38 controls (27.5%) (c2=3.86, p=0.0001). Scar shape has also demonstrated significant differences, i.e., the scar was lin-
ear in most study group patients (n=66, 83.5%) and stellar in controls (n=62, 77.5%) (c2=47.23, p=0.001). Accelerated healing of the ulcer in the study group
and more significant inflammation in the controls were confirmed by ultrasound.
Conclusions. Running two-level suturing technique is characterized by various advantages, i.e., (1) precise approximation of gastric walls due to the sutur-
ing technique which provides layer-by-layer wound healing; (2) minimal compression of intramural vessels and microcirculation abnormalities when sutur-
ing; (3) the avoidance of the contacts between the sutures and the lumen and the contamination of gastric/duodenal wall internal layers. Wound healing con-
ditions are more favorable due to the uniform suture allocation with every stitch, the abscence of the knots between the levels, and more close approximation
of serous membranes at the site of the suturing thus minimizing the risks of microabscesses, local ischemia, and suture cutting through the tissues.
Key words: perforated ulcer, ulcer healing, fibrogastroduodenoscopy.
