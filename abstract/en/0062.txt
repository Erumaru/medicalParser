The review presents modern information on the possibility of the formation of rhythm disturbances, such as atrial fibrillation, prolongation of the QTc inter-
val, ventricular arrhythmias and HBB in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The article shows a world-wide prevalence of obesity and non-alco-
holic fatty liver disease. Possible pathogenetic mechanisms of the formation of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are con-
sidered. The article describes possible involvement of a number of factors associated with the metabolic syndrome, such as C reactive protein, tumor necro-
sis factor alpha, interleukin-6, transforming growth factor beta, endothelin -1 in the formation of ultrastructural changes in cardiomyocytes, increase in fi-
broblasts differentiation and myocardium fibrosis, which serves as a risk factor for the formation of cardiac arrhythmias. There is a connection between the
thickness of epicardial fat layer and the progression of insulin resistance, increased risk of cardiac accidents and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It is shown
that in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias are similar to those in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with-
out diabetes mellitus, and even factors associated with diabetes mellitus did not have such a significant influence on the occurrence of cardiac rhythm dis-
turbances.
Key words: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, heart rhythm disturbances, atrial fibrillation, QTc interval elongation, ventricular arrhythmias.
