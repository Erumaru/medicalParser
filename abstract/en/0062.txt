The global spread of antibiotic resistance among pathogens of community-acquired respiratory diseases against the background of a reduction in the devel-
opment of new antibiotics is a serious threat to public health in most countries of the world. In this regard, it is necessary to rationally use the antibacterial
drugs taking into account the natural activity and acquired resistance of the pathogen, as well as the severity and complications of the disease. An alternative
to the systemic use of antibiotics in some cases is the topical use of drugs. The article deals with the use, effectiveness and safety of thiamphenicol glycinate
acetylcysteinate (TGA) for respiratory diseases in children. In Russia, TGA is represented by the preparation Fluimucil®-antibiotic IT, and is available as a
lyophilizate for the preparation of a solution that can be used for injections and inhalations. TGA helps to improve the course of the disease, in some cases
avoid invasive procedures and reduce the use of systemic antibiotics.
Key words: respiratory infections, children, thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteinate, antibiotic therapy, inhalation therapy, rhinosinusitis, acute bronchitis.
