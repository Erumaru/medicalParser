Skin is like an alarm system for the body which can alert to all kinds of health issues. Figuratively speaking, a human body is similar to a hollow tube: skin
covers the external surface while gastrointestinal tract is the lumen. Makeup products are often used to hide skin problems. However, these external mani-
festations mask gastrointestinal problems. The task for a dermatologist is to identify primary cause of skin disorder, to provide primary health care, and to
refer a patient to the specialist who will be able to eliminate the primary cause of the disease. The role of a dermatologist is to eradicate the consequences of
skin comorbidities. Optimal algorithm of complex interdisciplinary treatment will result in maximum effect.
Gastrointestinal disorders (i.e., infection with Helicobacter pylori, gastroesophageal reflux disease, pancreatoduodenal and hepatobiliary disorders, changes
of intestinal microbiocenosis etc.) play an important role in the development of certain dermatoses.
Dermadrome manifestations of gastrointestinal disorders, their diagnosis and therapy are discussed.
