Hemorrhagic disorders in children are acute conditions requiring urgent provision of adequate medical care. The article highlights the issues of polyethiologic
origin and development of this pathological condition. Late hemorrhagic disease of the newborn is a collective concept that, unlike the term "hemorrhagic
disease of the fetus and newborn", can not be used for nosological verification. This is due to the fact that in children of the first weeks and months of life, the
vitamin K deficiency resulting in hemorrhagic disorders can be caused by a number of reasons - an alimentary factor (feeding exclusively by mother's milk),
developmental defects of the hepatobiliary system, hereditary, congenital and acquired diseases with cholestasis and malabsorption, irrational use of antibi-
otics, prolonged parenteral nutrition with insufficient vitamin K supplementation, etc. In this regard, in each case of development of K-vitamin-deficient co-
agulopathy, early verification of the etiological factors is necessary. Timely elimination of the cause of vitamin K deficiency and etiopathogenetic approach
when choosing methods of treatment significantly increase the effectiveness of therapy and improve the prognosis in general.
Key words: vitamin K, breastfeeding, children, vitamin K deficiency, mother's milk, newborns, late hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.
