In  any  age  group,  disorders  of  intestinal  microflora  are  among  the  causes  of  various  pathological  conditions.  To  correct 
those  disorders,  probiotics  (products  of  active  microorganisms)  and  prebiotics  (oligosaccharides  that  stimulate  the  growth 
of beneficial microflora) are utilized. These days, the use of metabolic extracts from probiotic bacteria, which being similar 
to oligosaccharide prebiotics in that they stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria, attracts more attention. The metabolites 
from such microflora representative species as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus 
helveticus facilitate the growth of beneficial intestinal microflora, and can act as antagonists of pathogenic microflora. A great 
experience of using Hylak forte with various pathological conditions in patients of different ages has been accumulated. There 
are specific uses of this drug in certain clinical situations. The works devoted to the use of Hylak forte in practical medicine 
are published both in Russia and abroad. As a result of studies of the effectiveness of the drug it was found that its prebiotic 
properties are aimed not only at optimizing the functional state of the intestine, but they also participate in the regulation of 
important homeostatic mechanisms at the level of the macroorganism.
Key words: dysbiosis, gastrointestinal tract, metabiotic, Hylak forte.
