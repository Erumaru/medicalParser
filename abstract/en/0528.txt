Localized scleroderma refers to chronic autoimmune dermatoses and is characterized by the local inflammation foci manifestation in various 
body parts with subsequent skin sclerosis and/or skin atrophy formation and underlying tissues. The article highlights the main etiology, 
pathogenesis and clinical manifestations aspects of the disease. An in­house follow­up case study of patients with a clinical picture untypical 
for plaque scleroderma demonstrates the diagnostic process complexity.
The  first  patient  had  cutaneous  eruptions  on  her  body,  which  were  of  an  unusual  ring­shaped  form  and  resembled  the  atrophic  form  of 
lichen planus or granuloma annulare. Two other patients were diagnosed with deep scleroderma on the lower extremities, which during its 
onset simulated clinical manifestations of vasculitis, lupus erythematosus or toxicoderma, what brought to delayed diagnosis. In some cases, 
localized scleroderma requires a more meticulous patients examination with pathohistological study application, as early diagnostics and 
timely beginning of treatment can stop disease progression and minimize atrophic and sclerotic process consequences, improving by that 
patient’s life quality.
