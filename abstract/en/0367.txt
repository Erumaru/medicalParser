Chronic pain syndromes (HPS) take one of the central places in the structure of the clinical symptom complex of various diseases and traumas of the nervous
system. The modern doctrine of analgesic therapy is based on the data of fundamental research on the neurophysiological mechanisms of pain, and is aimed
at the need to form disease-modifying therapeutic complexes. In this regard, optimization of medical care for patients with HPS implies an in-depth topical-
nosological analysis of pain using the newest diagnostic complexes. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) form a significant part of the medicines
intended for pharmacotherapy of HBS. The main difference between NSAIDs is their safety (complications from the gastrointestinal tract and cardiovascular
complications). Aceclofenac is a drug with a moderate selectivity for COX2, which makes its applicable in neurological practice. The article discusses in
detail the issues of differential diagnosis of back pain, statistical data on the etiology of HPS, the pathogenesis of pain syndrome and the connection of
clinical symptoms with the alleged mechanisms of neuropathic pain. This review provides basic data on the mechanisms of chronic pain and the prerequisites
for the rational combination of drugs from different pharmacological groups.
Key words: chronic pain, nociceptive afferentation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aceclofenac (Alental ®).
