The article is devoted to the possibilities of local therapy of inflammatory diseases of the upper respiratory tract, the frequency of which in recent years has
no tendency to decrease. The authors consider the most frequently used groups of topical preparations, the mechanism of their action, advantages and dis-
advantages. The authors conclude that in the conditions of the growth of antibiotic resistance of microorganisms, it is becoming more important to use an-
timicrobial drugs, which do not affect the biocenosis of the mucous membranes of the ENT organs and have minimal side effects. Such properties are char-
acteristic for silver preparations, which have been known and used in medicine for a long time, but somewhat lost their relevance in the era of antibiotics. The
authors discuss the bactericidal, antifungal and antiviral effects of a 2% solution of silver proteinate (protargol), as well as its anti-inflammatory and as-
tringent effects. Many researchers point out the effectiveness of protargol in the treatment of inflammatory diseases of the upper respiratory tract, there-
fore 2% silver proteinate is used in the local therapy of acute and chronic rhinitis, sinusitis, adenoids. The authors express the opinion that 2% silver proteinate
can be successfully used in the therapy of inflammatory diseases of the upper respiratory tract due to the convenient form of release, the stability of the so-
lution during the month and the safety of the active substance.
Key words: inflammation, upper respiratory tract, silver proteinate
