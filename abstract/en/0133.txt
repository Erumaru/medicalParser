Given the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and the continued increase in the number of such patients in the population, as well as a significant in-
crease in the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular complications in these patients, the problem of managing a patient with cardio-
vascular disease on the background of DM is very actual. Such patients have a common, usually combined structure of risk factors and have an extremely
unfavorable prognosis in terms of development of macro- and microvascular complications, general and cardiovascular mortality. The article emphasizes the
necessity of correcting arterial pressure, medicamental influence on the prevention of micro- and macrovascular complications. It is also important to elim-
inate the dyslipidemic disorders, and to use the metabolic drugs. One of the modern requirements for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with con-
comitant diseases of the cardiovascular system is an individual approach to the selection of anti-ischemic, lipid-controlling, antihypertensive and hypo-
glycemic agents, with mandatory non drug treatment. Successful prevention of cardiovascular complications in such patients is possible in case of high com-
pliance between the patient and the doctor, because strict control of blood glucose, blood lipid levels and adequate therapy of hypertension, CHD will lead to
a significant reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular complications in these patients and will improve their survival.
Key words: diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular diseases, arterial hypertension, metabolic therapy, risk factor, microangiopathy.
