Currently, nonspecific back pain is generally recognized as a global health issue due to its high occurrence in the population. Degenerative dystrophic spine
conditions which affect disc, facet joints, muscles, ligaments, and nerves are pathogenic basis of nonspecific back pain. Tonic muscle (or myofascial) syndrome
is one of the most common pathogenic mechanisms of back pain. The treatment of nonspecific (primary) pain requires rational strategy depending on the
dominant clinical sign. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remain the “gold standard” for this disorder. Nimesulide characterized by good
safety and efficacy (moderate quality of evidence) can be considered as a first-choice therapy. Complex treatment should include measures to reduce risk
factors and to prevent exacerbations. The patient should also be educated to begin the treatment early since it prevents back pain chronicity.
Key words: nonspecific back pain, degenerative disk disorder, spondyloarthrosis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
