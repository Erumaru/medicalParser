Summary
Currently, a wide range of drugs are available in Russia. In this context, the key issue for an internist is to choose safe and effective diuretic therapy. The most
commonly used diuretics excrete sodium, i.e., these drugs inhibit sodium reabsorption in the renal tubules thus leading to passive water excretion. Loop di-
uretics with short half-life provoke spike-like sodium diuresis followed by significant post-dose sodium retention. Spike-like sodium diuresis results in acute
tubule damage caused by excess sodium. In rapid and excessive sodium excretion, this damage is irreversible. According to multiple studies, torasemide
SR/Britomar is characterized by lower absorption rate and, therefore, longer half-life. The drug provides more effective and constant sodium diuresis thus
reducing the risk of renal tubule damage. The absence of rebound sodium retention tends to decrease central blood pressure, augmentation index, and aor-
tic pulse wave velocity which are considered to be independent markers of cardiovascular risk and death.
Key words: sodium, diuretics, torasemide SR, sodium diuresis.
