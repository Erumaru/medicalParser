Based on the results of experimental and clinical studies the article reviews the modern insights into the approaches to the risk assessment in chronic forms
of coronary artery disease, the relationship between the main biomarkers of bone tissue metabolism (calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, osteopon-
tin and osteoprotegerin)  and the other biological markers (systemic inflammatory response, myocardial dysfunction and ischemic myocardial damage), the
severity of manifestations of coronary atherosclerosis and traditional indicators characterizing the cardiovascular health (parameters of lipid and carbohy-
drate homeostasis, body weight).  The article presents perspectives of risk assessment in patients with coronary heart disease on the basis of determination
of the bone tissue metabolism markers. Further clinical studies are needed to assess the clinical and prognostic significance of these indicators. The available
materials from foreign library databases, such as Library's MEDLINE/PubMed database, were used in the review. 
Key words: atherosclerosis, risk factors, biomarkers, bone metabolism, coronary calcification, parathyroid hormone, osteopontin, osteoprotegerin.
