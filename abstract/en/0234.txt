The article presents the current state of the use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in the practice of a physician based on current 
clinical recommendations and the results of randomized clinical trials. The advantage of using enteric forms of the drug is 
shown. The mechanism of antiplatelet action of ASA is described. The possibilities of using ASA for primary and secondary 
prevention  of  atherothrombotic  complications  of  ischemic  heart  disease  are  discussed  in  detail.  The  evidence  base  for  the 
long-term use of aspirin for the prevention of such repeated cardiovascular events as myocardial infarction, unstable angina, 
ischemic stroke, and associated mortality is now undoubted. Long-term use of ASA for primary prevention of cardiovascular 
events by persons without clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis does not provide a reduction in cardiovascular mortality 
and at the same time increases the incidence of large gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeding. The issues of safety of ASA and 
the possibility of reducing the risk of gastropathy are considered. Additional effects of acetylsalicylic acid on the prevention of 
certain forms of oncopathology are shown. So the daily use of aspirin in a dosage of 75–100 mg is associated with a decrease 
in the risk of colorectal cancer and other types of oncology.
Key  words:  atherothrombosis,  ischemic  heart  disease,  cardiovascular  diseases,  cardiovascular  mortality,  acute  coronary 
syndrome, acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin, Sanovasc.
