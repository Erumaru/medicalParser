Klippel – Trenaunay – Weber (KTW) syndrome is a congenital angiodysplasia of peripheral vessels with the formation of pathological 
arteriovenous communications, the presence of which causes the violation of blood flow along the main veins of the affected limb 
with the development of varicose transformation of superficial veins of the extremities. The syndrome is characterized by a variety 
of clinical manifestations, so treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach. The disease needs surgical treatment, often with a 
large number of complications. In the vast majority of cases, staged surgical treatment is used, it is often traumatic and leads to 
a large number of complications (bleeding, trophic ulcers, hypertrophic and keloid scars). The frequency of postoperative relapse 
reaches 30–48%. The article presents a clinical case of chronic lung abscess in a patient with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. 
The presented clinical case is a unique example of the combination of the syndrome of congenital angiodysplasia and chronic lung 
abscess. Patients with KTW syndrome rarely come into the view of a pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon, and this clinical case is a 
clear illustration of the possible pulmonary manifestation of congenital angiodysplasia.
Key words: Klippel – Trenaunay – Weber syndrome, lung abscess, clinical case.
