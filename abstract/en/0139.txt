The article presents the incidence of respiratory tract damage during intubation and prolonged artificial lung ventilation (ALV), 
based on the own experience of the authors and literature data. The article gives the analysis of the causes and factors of damage 
to the larynx and trachea from the standpoint of anesthesiologists, emergency physicians and otorhinolaryngologists, as well as 
a complex of organizational, diagnostic and therapeutic measures aimed at their prevention and treatment. Conservative therapy 
of inflammatory changes in the larynx and trachea in patients after ventilation is extremely multifaceted and includes a number 
of well-known components: antimicrobial and respiratory therapy, physiotherapy, immunotherapy, restorative treatment and 
much more. The article defines the time of the «tracheostomy» during the ventilation, the algorithm for the dekanulation of 
patients. In cases of development of cicatricial stenosis of the larynx and / or trachea the conservative methods of treatment are 
used, as well as the surgery methods with endo / extra laryngeal or endo / extra tracheal approaches. The role of endoscopy 
in the diagnosis and treatment of post-intubation and posttracheostomic injuries of the larynx and trachea is described, and 
schemes for the rational pharmacotherapy of inflammatory changes in the respiratory tract are given.
Key  words:  tracheal  intubation,  artificial  lung  ventilation,  tracheostomy,  decanulation,  erosive  tracheitis,  laryngostenosis, 
tracheal stenosis, videoimage laryngo-tracheal bronchoscopy.
