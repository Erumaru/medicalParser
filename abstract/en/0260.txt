The increase in the number of chronic inflammatory diseases of the upper respiratory tract and middle ear proves the need to develop new technologies for
studying their pathogenesis, predicting, early diagnosis and treatment. The article clearly shows that biological fluids are the most convenient for studying
the dynamics of physiological and pathological processes of the body. They play the most important role in the vital activity of the human body providing it
with energy and plastic material while performing informational, managerial and executive functions. Violation of the biological fluids composition of the mu-
cous membrane of the upper respiratory tract plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. One of the most promising areas of research in
medicine is the «morphology of human biological fluids». This fundamental direction represents a fundamentally new approach to the study of diseases, al-
lows the development of new tests and criteria for an objective assessment of the state of biological fluids for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of var-
ious organs and systems. 
Key words: biological fluid, morphology of biological fluid, wedge dehydration, system self-organization, structuring, structure, solid phase.
