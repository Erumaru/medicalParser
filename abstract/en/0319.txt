The paper reviews domestic and foreign literature data on pain treatment in comorbid patients and addresses pathogenesis, diagnostic aspects, and treatment
approaches to nociceptive, neuropathic, and dysfunctional pain. Back pain is of special importance. Causative, iatrogenic, unspecified, and random comor-
bidities in neurology are discussed. Management approach to back pain in comorbidities is described. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) should
be selected depending on the risk of gastroenterological and cardiovascular side effects. Algorithm of NSAID choice to reduce back pain based on step-by-
step comorbidity assessment is easy to use in daily practice. The findings from randomized clinical trials which demonstrate better safety profile of amtol-
metin guacil are highlighted. Experimental study results and clinical experience indicate that amtolmetin guacil can be recommended for back pain. Safety
profile of this agent is significantly superior to safety profile of other non-selective NSAIDs and is at least similar to that of selective COG2. Therefore, am-
tolmetin guacil can be used in multiple comorbidities.
Key words: analgesic effect, side effects, nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain, dysfunctional pain, topical diagnosis, amtolmetin guacil.
