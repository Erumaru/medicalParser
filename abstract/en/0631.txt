Vertebral compression fractures provoke chronic and acute pains as well as progressive destruction of the spinal column. The treatment of spinal fractures
resulting from osteoporosis is an important issue of modern traumatology and orthopedics. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are minimally invasive techniques
for painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. These procedures in which bone cement is injected into the fractured vertebra provide favorable clin-
ical outcomes (pain reduction in 90% of patients).
The aim of this study was to assess various osteoplastic materials for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty as well as to analyze published data on treatment out-
comes. PubMed, PubMed Central, and eLIBRARY search for Russian and English papers published between 2006 and 2016 was performed.
This paper addresses the results of experimental studies and clinical trials on the efficacy of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty using various osteoplastic ma-
terials and their complications.
Key words: osteoporosis, compression fractures, osteoplastic materials, vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty.
