External and secondary otitis media are socially significant diseases occurring mainly in children and adults of working age, which often recur and have a
tendency to chronicity. In this regard, the development of an optimal algorithm for the treatment of patients with inflammatory processes in the external and
middle ear is an urgent task of clinical otorhinolaryngology. When diagnosing otitis, it is important to define of the microflora of the organism, the presence
of fungi and various microorganisms associations, the resistance of which to antibiotic therapy often negatively affects the results of the treatment. Together
with other causes of inflammation in the middle and external ear, the microbiological aspect becomes a factor of etiotropic therapy. The pronounced staging
of acute otitis media suggests an individual approach to treatment in each of these stages. At present antibiotics are considered to be the drugs of choice in
the treatment of patients with external and secondary otitis media. Due to the development of severe pain and inflammation in the ear, an important role is
played by preparations of analgesic and anti-inflammatory therapy. Its effectiveness is confirmed by complex topical preparations with antimicrobial and
analgesic effect (Anauran).
Key words: external and middle otitis media, etiotropic therapy, topical antibacterial drugs.
