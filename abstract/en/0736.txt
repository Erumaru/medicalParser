Currently, levofloxacin is one of the most popular antimicrobial drugs. A huge experience has been accumulated in the practical 
use of the antibiotic, which indicates its high efficacy and safety in the treatment of infections of various localizations. One of the 
priority indications for the levofloxacin prescription are community-acquired infections of the lower respiratory tract (LRTI).
Despite its long history, levofloxacin remains a reliable antibiotic used for the treatment of community-based LRTIs. Advantages 
of levofloxacin include high activity with respect to respiratory pathogens, proven efficacy, good tolerability, convenient dosing 
regimen (1p / day), availability in oral dosage forms and parenteral administration. At the same time, it should be noted that the 
future of the drug, the preservation of its antimicrobial activity depends on a rational approach to prescribing an antibiotic. The 
high-dose regimen of prescribing levofloxacin (750 mg / day), which allows to create higher antibiotic concentrations, has been 
successfully used in short courses of antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, as well as in patients 
with complicated exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and is considered as one of the options for optimizing 
the approach to the use of the drug.
Key words: community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections, antibacterial therapy, pneumonia, antibiotics, levofloxacin.
