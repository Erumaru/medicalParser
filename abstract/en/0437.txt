Cough is one of the most frequent symptoms of respiratory tract diseases and is a protective reflex aimed at cleansing the air-
ways in conditions of insufficient mucociliary clearance. In accordance with some characteristics of cough, doctors can often 
determine the localization, and sometimes even the nature of the disease that causes it. Cough can be productive and not pro-
ductive by nature (depending on the presence of sputum, cough can be acute, subacute or chronic depending on its duration). 
The cause of acute cough is usually upper and lower respiratory tract infections, in addition, cough may indicate a disease that 
the doctor can not miss, such as bronchial asthma, bronchiolitis, whooping cough, pneumonia and aspiration of foreign bodies. 
Subacute coughing can be caused by hyperreactivity of the airways after an infection, whooping cough, bronchial asthma. 
The effectiveness of cough treatment largely depends on a correctly and timely diagnosed disease and is aimed at diluting 
sputum, reducing its adhesiveness (viscosity) and increasing the effectiveness of coughing. If it is necessary to prescribe an-
tibacterial therapy, the drug of choice in this case is tiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteinate (TGA), which is used in the form 
of inhalation.
Key words: children, cough, respiratory diseases, mucolytic therapy, antibacterial therapy, inhalation therapy, thiamphenicol 
glycinate acetylcysteinate (TGA).
