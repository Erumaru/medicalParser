The paper summarizes the data on epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of moderate to severe acne. Strategies of acne treatment depend on clinical
type and disease severity, age and sex, comorbidities, prior therapy and its efficacy, and recurrences. The paper discusses treatment approaches to various
acne types. Special attention is given to systemic retinoids, the mechanism of their action, efficacy, side-effects, and the causes of recurrences. Acnecutan is
a modern systemic retinoid which efficacy is similar to that of brand name drug. However, Acnecutan has a number of advantages. Considering that intes-
tine-liver recirculation may play a significant role, pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin/Acnecutan is described. Acnecutan which was developed on the basis of
novel drug delivery system (Lidose(R)) includes two additional components which help to dissolve isotretinoin thus improving drug uptake as compared with
standard isotretinoin. Long-term experience with Acnecutan and our clinical observations confirm its efficacy and safety. The paper reviews the experience
with Acnecutan in 46 patients with moderate-to-severe acne. The treatment resulted in clinical recovery. High efficacy and good tolerability of Acnecutan was
demonstrated.
