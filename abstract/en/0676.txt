In Russia, the level of Helicobacter pylori infection remains quite high. Currently, the new approaches to H. pylori eradication are being persistently searched
for because the effectiveness of traditional methods of eradication therapy (ET) has decreased. One way to overcome the resistance of H. pylori is the more
effective deacidification with high doses of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and the use of stronger acid reducing drugs.
The aim of the research was to study the effectiveness of ET on the basis of various PPIs in patients with H. pylori gastritis.
Patients and methods: 108 patients with chronic H. pylori gastritis were included into the study. By random number method 2 groups of 54 patients were
formed to analyze the effectiveness of ET. The first group of patients received standard triple ET based on esomeprazole (Nexium) (esomeprazole 40 mg/day
(Nexium®) + clarithromycin 1 g / day + amoxicillin 2 g / day) for 14 days. The second group of patients received standard triple ET based on other PPI
(omeprazole 40 mg/day, or pantoprazole 80 mg / day, or rabeprazole 40 mg / day, or lansoprazole 60 mg / day + clarithromycin 1 g/day + amoxicillin
2 g/day) for 14 days. Efficacy was monitored 6 months later by a histological method and H. pylori antigen testing in feces by polymerase chain reaction.

Results: H. pylori elimination was achieved with the use of esomeprazole (Nexium) in 92.6% of patients, whereas in the case of other PPIs, only 77.8% of pa-
tients had it. Esomeprazole (Nexium®) has a reliable acid-suppressive effect, and its use is the key to effective ET even in the hyperacid gastritis.
Conclusions: the dependence of the ET efficacy on the proton pump inhibitor has been established. The eradication schemes with esomeprazole (Nexium®)
showed advantages in the patients of complex categories: with a low degree of contamination, in conditions of atrophy of the mucous membrane of the antrum
of the stomach, as well as at any degree of activity of the inflammatory process.
