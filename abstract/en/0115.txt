Diuretics  are  the  drugs  used  to  enhance  diuresis,  remove  excess  amounts  of  water  from  the  body  and  eliminate  edema.  
The review presents clinical and pharmacological approaches to diuretic therapy, data on the use of the main classes of diuretics. 
The article focuses on the efficasy and safety of loop diuretics, and the latest drug from this group — torasemide, which has 
additional  advantages.  Due  to  the  ability  of  torasemide  to  block  aldosterone  receptors  thus  inhibiting  myocardial  fibrosis, 
this drug may provide additional benefits in terms of slowing the progression of chronic heart failure and increasing patient 
survival. The efficasy and safety of torasemide are practically not affected even by a significant decrease in the glomerular 
filtration rate. Torasemide is a probable alternative to furosemide in the treatment of edematous-ascitic syndrome, including the 
one resistant to diuretics, in patients with liver cirrhosis. Torasemide is better tolerated than other loop diuretics. Torasemide, 
obviously, should be considered as the drug of choice for the treatment of most variants of edematous syndrome, including those 
resistant to standard diuretic therapy.
Key words: diuretics, torasemide, chronic heart failure, arterial hypertension, chronic renal failure, efficacy, safety, edemas, Trigrim®.
