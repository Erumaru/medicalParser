The article presents literature data on the prevalence of traumatic fractures of the condylar process. Particular attention is paid to the problem of fracture
of the head of the condylar process. Despite the small percentage of the occurrence of this type of injury, the problem of treating this pathology remains rel-
evant for maxillofacial surgeons both in our country and abroad. The article gives the literature data concerning the difficulties of clinical and radiological
diagnostics of the fractures of the condylar process head, the ambiguity of surgical indications, and a special complexity of the surgical intervention in these
fractures. The new presented method of osteosynthesis of the condylar process has been developed and implemented by the department of maxillofacial
surgery of the Moscow Regional Research and Clinical Institute named after M.F. Vladimirskiy. The evaluation of the efficacy of the proposed technique
shows better functional results of the treatment in comparison with traditional methods. The use of the developed technique allowed to abandon the inter-
maxillary fixation in the postoperative period, and achieve early functional rehabilitation of the patients with fractures of the condylar process head.
Key words: lower jaw, condylar process, head, fracture, osteosynthesis, replantation, cannulated screw.
