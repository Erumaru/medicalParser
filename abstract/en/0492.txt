The paper addresses quality of life improvement in children with heart rhythm disorders (HRD). We used the program of diselementosis correction and
vitamin A deficiency in terms of complex treatment and rehabilitation program. The study included 198 children (107 boys and 91 girls) aged 6-17 years old
with various HRD (supraventricular and ventricular premature beats, sick sinus syndrome, chronic non-paroxysmal tachycardia, paroxysmal supraventric-
ular tachycardia), conduction disorders (Wolff - Parkinson - White syndrome, atrioventricular block II-III degree). Children were hospitalized in pediatric
cardiac surgery and rehabilitation department of the Institute of Emergency and Reconstructive Surgery named after V.K. Gusak in the period from 2006 to
2010, and then were followed up as outpatients for 5 years with control 1 time per 6 months. The control group included 57 healthy children (31 boys and 26
girls). Treatment efficacy was assessed by dynamics of health indicators and status: ECG and 24-h ECG monitoring, indicators of bioelement status, organ-
ism's vitamin supply, degree of decrease of absolute and relative risk of treatment failure, as well as with own procedure "Method of evaluation the therapy
effectiveness in children with heart rhythm disorder", based on a comprehensive assessment of quality of life (patent UA № 12261 акщь 16.01.2006).
Results demonstrated that additional program of diselementosis and vitamin A deficiency correction led to restoration of heart rhythm in 35,6 ± 4,7% of pa-
tients, decrease of arrhythmic syndrome severity in 48,1 ± 4,9%, improvement of health and state in 87,5 ± 3,2%, recovery of bioelement status in 69,2 ±
4,5%, and sufficient supply of vitamin D, B9, B12 in 64,4 ± 4,7% of patients. Prognosis of arrhythmia clinical course improved in 49,0 ± 4,9% of children.
Quality of life improved in 88,2 ± 4,5% of patients with functional HRD and 68,8 ± 4,7% in patients with organic arrhythmias.
This paper stresses the importance of diselementosis and vitamin A deficiency correction in the complex treatment and rehabilitation program in children with HRD.
Key words: heart rhythm disorders, quality of life, vitamin deficiency, diselementosis, bioelement status, arrhythmia, children.
