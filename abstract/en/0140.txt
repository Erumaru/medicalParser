Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (GOLD 2016) pays special attention to reduction of clinical symptoms, improving quality of life
with minimal side effects of therapy. Indeed, the most common reason for a first visit to therapist of the patient with suspected diagnosis of COPD is new com-
plaints or exacerbation of symptoms (such as an increase in sputum, appearance or exacerbation of purulent sputum, increased dyspnea, elevated body tem-
perature). Patients with symptoms, regardless of their appearance time during the day, have worse prognosis and quality of life (deterioration of well being,
development of depression, anxiety, poor sleep). The paper presents for the first time quality indicators of care in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), based on guidelines of the Ministry of Health. The characteristic of modern medical treatment of patients with stable COPD is given according to
levels of evidence and strength-of-recommendation. Algorithm for early COPD diagnosis is presented as well as indications for referral to pulmonologist and
algorithm for initial treatment of patients with COPD.
Key words: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, quality indicators, algorithm for early diagnosis and initial treatment.
