In patients with the fever of unknown origin associated with articular syndrome, differential diagnosis between infectious and inflammatory disorders is chal-
lenging for a practitioner. The combination of two independent conditions makes correct diagnosis even more difficult. 
This paper reports on a woman with multiple infectious arthritis and primarily diagnosed ankylosing spondylitis. The patient presented with complaints of
right knee swelling and pain, high body temperature (38.5°C), severe thoracic and low back pain, diarrhea, and general weakness. Differential diagnosis in-
cluded exacerbation of chronic urinary infection, cancer, multiple infectious arthritis, and exacerbation of spondyloarthritis due to the prior infection. An-
tibacterial agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and glucocorticoids were prescribed to achieve stable clinical effect. Considering the lack of fur-
ther improvement, tumor necrosis factor αinhibitor was prescribed when infectious process was under control.
This case report illustrates complex relations between infection and autoimmune inflammation and successful resolution of this situation.
Key words: fever of unknown origin, articular syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis.
