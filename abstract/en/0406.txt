Patients with diabetes have a high risk of developing cardiovascular complications. Long-term management of diabetes mellitus includes not only the achieve-
ment of targeted glycemic control. Currently, the majority of clinicians, including endocrinologists, adhere to tactics, which includes both the intensive re-
duction of lipid levels, above all, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure control to prevent cardiovascular diseases. Statins is the class of
drugs most often prescribed to patients with diabetes mellitus. Over the past few years, there have been reports in the literature of an increased risk of de-
veloping carbohydrate metabolism disorders when taking statins, which again and again draw the attention of both researchers and clinicians to the prob-
lem of safety of their appointment to patients who are at high risk of cardiovascular complications. This article is devoted to the analysis of the relationship
between the benefits and risks of developing adverse events, including the possible development of diabetes mellitus on the background of statin therapy. It
is shown that over the past 25 years, in numerous studies of statins and their effect on cardiovascular end-points there is no clear relationship between statin
therapy and the development of type 2 diabetes. The article highlights the need to more actively identify patients with risk factors for the breakdown of car-
bohydrate metabolism and to take efforts to prevent the manifestation of diabetes mellitus.
Key words: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, statins, cardiovascular risk, blood lipids.
