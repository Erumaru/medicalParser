Numerous studies demonstrate that cervical spine disorders provoke cephalgia in more than 50% of headaches. The symptoms of cervicogenic headaches were
described in the beginning of 20th century. However, there are still many controversies on the diagnosis of cervicogenic headaches. This condition is defined
as a symptom complex resulted from cervical spine disorders in terms of etiology and pathogenesis. The paper addresses the terminology and mechanisms
of cervicogenic headache symptoms considering anatomy and physiology of cervical spine. The signatures of cervical ligament myofascial syndrome and my-
ofascial pain syndrome as well as the role of vascular factor in the development of cervicogenic headache symptoms are discussed. Diagnostic criteria and
diagnostic algorithm for cervicogenic headaches are detailed. The paper uncovers differential diagnostic aspects of cervicogenic headaches and other types
of headaches (among them, migraine without aura is of special importance). Major principles of medical and non-medical treatment of cervicogenic
headaches are summarized. Therapeutic effects of some drugs as well as the role of cervical kinesio taping are reviewed.
Key words: cervicogenic headaches, cervical pain, spinal biomechanics, kinesio taping.
