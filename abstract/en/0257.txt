According to statistics of the Ministry of health of Russia the primary disease incidence in focal infectious-inflammatory pathology of ENT organs of the adult
and child population has no tendency to decrease. The main reasons for the excess incidence are unfavorable epidemiological situation of acute respiratory
viral infections that causes secondary immunodeficiency disorders and bacterial infections of ENT organs, resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics, due
to genetic mechanisms, as well as pathogens ability to form "biofilms". The only group of antibacterial drugs that have the ability to impact on the bacterial
biofilms are the macrolides. The main application of roxithromycin – a semi-synthetic 14-membered macrolide, is the therapy of ENT organs infections. The
modern studies that reveal the mechanisms of action of roxithromycin in relation to bacteria and the human body, suggests that the wide use of this drug in
otorhinolaryngological practice is justified. Roxithromycin has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. A high efficiency of roxithromycin in
treating infections of the upper respiratory tract and the middle ear was confirmed by the results of many randomized clinical trials.
Key words: ENT specialist care, macrolides, roxithromycin.
