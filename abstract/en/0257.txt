Chronic rhinosinusitis polyposa is one of the most urgent problems in modern otorhinolaryngology. Nasal polyps are known 
since ancient times. However, the processes of polypogenesis havenâ€™t been sufficiently studied untill now, and the problem of 
rhinosinusitis polyposa is still widespread. It is worth mentioning, that at the moment there are no uniform worldwide standards 
for treating patients with this pathology. Most of options proposed for conservative and surgical treatment have limitations 
in use, both medical and economic. Even in different regions and different medical institutions of our country patients with 
nasal polyps can be treated in various ways. In this review, we collect data about the evolution of the medical knowledge in the 
treatment of the polypous process in the nasal cavity, consider various modern approaches to the solution of therapeutic and 
surgical tasks in the treatment, as well as the prerequisites for the creation of new technologies.
Key words: chronic rhinosinusitis polyposa, polyps, surgical treatment, conservative therapy.
