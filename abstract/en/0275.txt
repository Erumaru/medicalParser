Cerebrovascular diseases are one of the most common causes of death, falling life expectancy and persistent disability. Thus, the most 
significant problems of modern medicine is improving the effectiveness of the preventive measures for stroke. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)  
is the antiplatelet therapy gold standard in vascular neurology. The article shows the ASA leading role in the first vascular event prevention 
in  patients  with  high  cardiovascular  risk.  The  personification  treatment  methods,  based  on  the  analysis  of  the  cranial  ultrasound 
screening results and laboratory tests are discussed. Conclusions about the need for the ASA use at the early stages of disease during the 
manifestation of the first symptoms were drawn on the basis of the current clinical guidelines analysis and the latest publications on the 
acute ischemic stroke problem. The ASA efficacy and safety in the early secondary prevention of stroke and other thrombotic complications 
were confirmed.
The article also contains new data on dual antiplatelet therapy after a stroke. The data, published in recent years, on the ASA low efficacy 
in  primary  stroke  prevention  does  not  eliminate  the  need  for  antiplatelet  therapy  in  high­risk  patients.  Cardiovascular  risk  stratification  
is a necessary condition for the safe and justified use of antiplatelet drugs to prevent the first vascular event.
