The frequency of unreasonable antibiotic therapy in pediatric practice is quite high, which promotes the growth of resistance of bacterial pathogens, increases
the frequency of adverse reactions of therapy and unnecessarily increases the cost of treatment. Primary bacterial etiology is typical for tonsillitis, epiglottitis,
pneumonia, also the disorders in the barrier function of the respiratory tract and a decrease in immunity can lead to activation of microbial autoflora and su-
perinfection with bacterial agents. In these cases antibiotics are prescribed taking into account the natural activity of the drugs and the possible resistance
of the pathogen, as well as the severity and complications of the disease. However, in a number of diseases, topical antibacterial drugs may serve as an al-
ternative to the use of systemic antibiotics. Thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteinate (TGA) is a complex preparation containing the broad – spectrum an-
tibiotic and a direct mucolytic N-acetylcysteine. It has shown a high efficiency in the treatment of diseases of the upper (acute and chronic rhinosinusitis,
otitis media, tonsillitis) and lower (acute bronchitis) respiratory tracts in both adults and children, enabling to improve the course of the disease, and in some
cases to avoid invasive procedures and reduce the need for use of systemic antibiotics.
Key words: upper and lower respiratory tract diseases, respiratory infections, children, thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteinate, rhinosinusitis, acute bron-
chitis.
