Summary
Current approaches to the management of coronary heart disease (CHD) include medications which improve the prognosis. However, metabolic drugs are
an important option as well. Cardioprotectors are metabolic drugs which action is mediated by the optimization of energy generation and consumption, the
correction of respiratory chain functions, the normalization of the equilibrium between the intensity of free radical oxidation and antioxidant protection. Since
most metabolic drugs failed to prove their value in terms of the influence on clinical manifestations and prognosis of CHD, some myths about cardioprotec-
tive therapy which make difficulties for its practical use have arisen. It is known that metabolic drugs are included in cardiovascular disease standards of care
and the List of essential and important drugs for medical use. It was demonstrated that metabolites act on the specific biochemical process only. Currently,
none of metabolic drugs are effective against the whole of homeostatic imbalances. One of the modern cardiometabolic and antioxidant drugs, morpholini-
um 3-methyl-1,2,4-triazoline-5-thioacetate/thiotriazolin, can normalize energy processes in cardiomyocytes. The effect of this medicine is realized at every
stage of hypoxic and ischemic tissue damage. The paper summarizes the indications for thiotriazolin, methods, and treatment regimens as well as the data
on pharmacoeconomic rationale of its use.
Key words: coronary heart disease, metabolic therapy, cardioprotective therapy, cardioprotectors, thiotriazolin, trimetazidine, meldonium.
