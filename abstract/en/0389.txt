To reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in middle-aged patients, it is important to control arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, and
glycemia in accordance with current recommendations of the scientific community. Patients over 75-80 years old make up the most fast growing part of the
population, but they are rarely included into randomized clinical trials, that makes a problem for a direct application of the existing clinical recommendations
for the prevention of cardiovascular disease to this category of patients. In addition, these patients often have accumulated functional deficits, the senile as-
thenia syndrome, polymorbidity, which often has a greater impact on prognosis than traditional risk factors, as well as high exposure to undesirable phe-
nomena due to changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs, and because of the appointment of a large number of medicines (polyphar-
macy). It must be admitted that we have the limited knowledge of how to optimally use the approaches to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, the ef-
fectiveness of which has been proved in younger people. It is necessary for the physicians managing the elderly patients to develop the skills of the manage-
ment of senile asthenia and the implementation of geriatric approaches in cooperation with geriatric physicians.
Key words: primary prevention, aging, senile asthenia, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, multimorbidity.
