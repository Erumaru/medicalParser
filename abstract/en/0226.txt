Patients with the peripheral edema are usually sent to a cardiologist with a diagnosis of chronic heart failure (CHF). The first task for the doctor in this case
is to confirm or exclude a cardiac origin of the edema. The following factors help to solve this problem: clinical features of edema in CHF, identification of
symptoms of venous hypertension and signs of organic heart disease. The presence of edema in CHF is an indication for the loop diuretics therapy. In com-
parison with furosemide, torasemide has a higher bioavailability (>80%) and a longer elimination half-life (3-4 hours). The diuretic action is very smooth, it
is less likely to cause the rebound effect. The positive impact of torasemide on the long-term prognosis in patients with CHF is explained by the minimal risk
of hypokalemia during torasemide treatment and the lack of hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system.
Key words: peripheral edema, chronic heart failure, a loop diuretic, torasemide
