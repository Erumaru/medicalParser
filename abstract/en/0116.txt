Glucocorticoids (GC) possess the anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory and anti-allergic properties, they are a valuable, and sometimes vital component of ther-
apy for the treatment of several diseases of broncho-pulmonary system, connective tissue, skin, autoimmune diseases and some types of cancer. Despite the ef-
fectiveness of these drugs, the retrospective observation of the patients undergoing GC therapy indicates that the use of GC, especially in large doses or over an
extended period, in most cases is accompanied by a significant risk of serious side effects. GC taking is associated with the development of carbohydrate metab-
olism disorder and lipid storage disease, musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, etc. This article presents a literature review of the impact of GC on vari-
ous systems of the body, and clinical recommendations for the management of patients during GC treatment. The review should help the doctors of various ther-
apeutic specialties, while prescribing GC treatment, to diagnose the side effects that occurred during therapy, and assign an appropriate therapy.
Key words: corticosteroids, avascular necrosis, steroid-induced diabetes, proximal myopathy, adrenal insufficiency, dysphonia, hypercortisolism, Cushing's
