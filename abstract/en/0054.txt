The review presents topical issues of the appointment of β-blockers in various clinical situations. β-blockers have antihypertensive effect and possess an-
tianginal and cardioprotective effects. β-blockers are one of the most effective classes of drugs that slow the progression of heart failure and reduce cardio-
vascular mortality. The β-blockers are a heterogeneous class of the drugs in terms of the opportunities of their clinical use. A number of β-blockers, especially
non-selective ones, have negative effects and can not be used in a number of clinical situations (metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus). Modern su-
per selective β-blockers do not have these negative effects and can be widely used in clinical practice, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus (DM)
type 2. The review focuses on metoprolol tartrate, which has the most extensive evidence base of its efficiency in cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Another prob-
lem related to β-blockers is their infrequent appointing or underdosing. In this regard, a practical doctor should be bolder in appointing them in the recom-
mended therapeutic doses according to the instructions for the medical use of the drug in various clinical situations. 
Key words: β-blockers, metabolic effects, heart rate, metoprolol.
