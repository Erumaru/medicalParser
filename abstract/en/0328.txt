According to the World Health Organization, one in every five persons in the world is a carrier of a fungal infection or suffers from a fungal disease. Ony-
chomycosis is one of the most common disorders in dermatology and accounts for 78% cases of dermatophytosis and 24% cases of skin disorders. The num-
ber of patients with mycosis and onychomycosis increases at the rate of 5% every year. Over the past decade, 2.5 times increase was seen. The major (80%
of cases) causative agents of onychomycoses are dermatophytes, yeast-like and mold fungi are less common. The paper discusses etiology and epidemiolo-
gy of onychomycosis, its prevalence among men and women, and the rate of familial onychomycosis (our data suggest that it occurs in 55%). Clinical man-
ifestations, onychomycosis types, clinical classification of fungal nail infections, and diagnostic tools are described. Exogenous and endogenous triggers as
well as current treatment approaches and topical and systemic therapies are reviewed. In some clinical situations, topical antifungal drugs can be used on-
ly. However, in a number of patients, a combination of drugs is reasonable and effective.
Key words: onychomycosis, trigger, causative agent, familial onychomycosis, combination therapy.
