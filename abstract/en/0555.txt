Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is a risk factor for esophageal cancer (EC) progression, the incidence of which has increased significantly over 
the past decade. According to the report on the cancer care facilities state in 2012, the esophageal cancer prevalence in Russia over the 
past 10 years has increased dramatically and amounted to 8.2 per 100 thousand population. However, the disease’s true prevalence in the 
population is unknown, given the following difficulties in establishing this diagnosis: the lack of available high-tech endoscopic methods in 
clinical practice and technical difficulties in taking biopsy material. At the same time, it is known that it is possible to prevent the neoplastic 
progression of the metaplastic epithelium with timely and rational patient treatment with BE. The patient management (in BE) main goal is to 
relieve symptoms, improve the patient’s life quality and prevent the esophagus epithelium dysplasia progression and EC. This review considers 
current approaches to patient management in BE on the basis of current data analysis of domestic and foreign literature.
