Almost every article devoted to the state of the digestive tract (DT) in young children begins with the phrase about the high incidence of digestive system dis-
orders in the first year of life.
Functional disorders (FD) of the digestive tract change the digestion and absorption of food, motor function, the composition of the intestinal microbiota, and
the activity of the immune system. The causes of FDs often lie outside the affected organ and are caused by a violation of the nervous and humoral regulation
of the digestive tract.
This article describes the algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of DT functional disordes in accordance with Roman criteria III. We consider such FDs as
posseting, rumination syndrome, cyclic vomiting syndrome, baby colics, functional diarrhea, baby dyschezia, functional constipation. Attention is given to
simethicone preparations (Sab® Simplex), which is used not only for treating baby colics, but also before diagnostic studies and for treating acute poisoning
with detergents in both children and adults.
Key words: functional disorders, posseting, rumination syndrome in infants, cyclical vomiting syndrome, baby colics, functional diarrhea, baby dyschezia,
functional constipation, simethicone preparations, Sab® Simplex.
