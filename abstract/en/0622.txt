Aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a chronic inflammatory airway disorder with three cardinal features – asthma, nasal polyps, and reac-
tions to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The data on epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of
this condition are summarized. True prevalence of AERD is unknown since there are no reliable biomarkers. Considering this, diagnostic principles, indica-
tions, and regimens of principal diagnostic provocation tests to verify AERD (i.e., oral, nasal, and inhalation) are discussed. This disease is characterized by
severe treatment-refractory asthma and rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Indications and preparing for polyposis surgery are reviewed. Novel methods of
complex treatment are described. Special attention is given to the aspirin desensitization which significantly improves quality of life as well as asthma and
polyposis symptoms. Therapeutic desensitization method can be included in the regimen of anti-inflammatory drug therapy when acetylsalicylic acid or oth-
er nonselective COX-2 inhibitors are required.
Key words: acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), aspirin-induced asthma, nasal polyposis, aspirin desensitization.
