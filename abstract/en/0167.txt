Modern surgery is based on the principles of aseptics and antiseptics, adequate anesthesia, replenishment of blood loss. Modern antiseptics include inorganic
substances, bioorganic and synthetic inorganic compounds. Currently, there is no "ideal antiseptic", which is caused by the properties of the drugs and the
characteristics of modern pathogenic microorganisms. To increase efficiency, it is necessary to introduce antiseptic agents with a broad antimicrobial spec-
trum. One such preparations is Betadine®, povidone-iodine in the form of a complex of polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine. The drug has several release forms and
can be used for prevention and treatment. It is possible to use the drug in the treatment of fresh wounds of soft tissues, skin of the surgical field, skin before
blood taking and biopsy, mucous membranes, "donor" wounds, postoperative scars, grafts. High effectiveness of the drug against pathogenic microorganisms
is associated with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity, long-term preservation of antiseptic properties, the absence of resistant forms of microorganisms,
absence of toxicity in long-term and frequent use, rare allergic reactions, storage stability.
Key words: prevention, wounds, surgical field, infectious complications, care, intravenous catheter, surgeon's hands, Betadine®, povidone-iodine.
