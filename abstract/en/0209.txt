Currently, in all countries there is a high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which remain the main cause of disability.That’s why an important
task for practicing doctors is to optimize the treatment of CVD in order to reduce the number of people with disabilities. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)
are the group of drugs that can positively influence the course and prognosis of CVD. Effectively reducing blood pressure, they have a number of additional
pleiotropic effects and less adverse effects. The article presents the pharmacological properties and clinical efficacy of angiotensin II receptor blockers in pa-
tients with arterial hypertension, chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic kidney disease from the point of view of evidence-based medicine and treatment
experience.In general, the number of large successful randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effectiveness of angiotensin II receptor blockers is rel-
atively small. However, among all the Sartans, candesartan has perhaps the most successful "evidence-based history" and its effectiveness has been studied
at various intensities of pathological process. Candesartan, has a strong and prolonged antihypertensive and organ-protective effect due to its high affinity
and strength of binding to the receptors of angiotensin type I. The therapeutic efficacy of candesartan is equivalent to other major classes of antihyperten-
sive drugs. The use of candesartan is highly effective in heart failure with systolic dysfunction.
Key words: angiotensin receptor blockers, arterial hypertension, chronic heart failure, candesartan, left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
