Insulinoma is the most frequent neuroendocrine tumor (up to 70–75% of the total), originating from β-cells of the Langerhans 
islets,  secreting  insulin  into  the  bloodstream  uncontrollably,  which  turn  up  as  the  cause  of  spontaneous  hypoglycemia. 
Insulinomas  are  rare  (1–4  cases  per  1  million  population  per  year)  and  in  most  cases  (up  to  90%)  are  benign,  malignant 
insulinomas occur in 5–10% of cases. Diagnosis of insulinoma may be delayed for several years since the onset of the disease 
as the symptoms of the disease are nonspecific and may be similar to the symptoms of mental, cardiovascular and neurological 
diseases. Surgical resection is the main treatment of insulinoma. In benign single insulinoma, small in size, located in the corpus 
or  cauda  pancreatis,  laparoscopic  surgery,  enucleation,  partial  or  middle  pancreatectomy  are  possible,  which  preserve  the 
healthy tissue of the pancreas, thus reducing the risk of pancreatic function insufficiency.
The article presents a clinical case of relapse of insulinoma in a patient after an open treatment of long-term insulinoma without 
adequate therapy. The authors provide brief information about the endogenous hyperinsulinism as the manifestation of insulinoma.
Key  words:  endogenous  hyperinsulinism,  hypoglycemia,  neuroendocrine  tumor,  insulinoma,  pancreatectomy,  laparoscopic 
surgery, clinical case.
