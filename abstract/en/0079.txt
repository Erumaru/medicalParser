Relieving an acute and subacute musculoskeletal pain is the most important element of the complex medical care for patients suffering from joint and spine
diseases. The time of starting the analgesic therapy is highly important: early prescription of effective treatment increases the probability of success and re-
duces the risk of pain chronicity. Therefore, the doctor should have in his arsenal reliable and safe painkillers, which can be used as the first step of a com-
prehensive program of analgesic therapy. Moreover, patients with the most common diseases of the musculoskeletal system - osteoarthritis and nonspecific
back pain, should be trained in effective methods of pain control. In this situation, it is reasonable to use non-prescription complex analgesics, represented
by a combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol, as the drugs of the “first stage”. They have a high anesthetic potential, accessibility and are easy to use. This
review briefly discusses the efficacy and safety of these drugs.
Key words: musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis, nonspecific back pain, paracetamol, ibuprofen, combined preparations.
