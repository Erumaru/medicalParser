Hypertension (or high blood pressure) is a multifactorial disease with genetic predisposition characterized by persistent increase in systolic (> 140 mm Hg)
and diastolic (> 90 mm Hg) blood pressure (BP). As a rule, hypertonics are prescribed with angiotensin II receptor antagonists or ACE inhibitors. However,
many persons have contraindications to the use of these drugs. In these patients, beta blockers can be recommended due to their effects on the whole of car-
diovascular components (i.e., they reduce high BP and provide reverse remodeling of the left ventricle). Metoprolol is a selective blocker of beta1-adrenore-
ceptors without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity but with weak membrane stabilizing effects. Large multicenter trials demonstrate the efficacy and safe-
ty of metoprolol succinate in hypertension, stable angina, heart rhythm disorders, chronic heart failure, secondary prevention of myocardial infarction, and
atherosclerosis. However, there are few comparative studies on hypotensive effect of various metoprolol formulations. This paper reviews the results of pio-
neer comparative study on clinical efficacy and safety of generic Egiloc S and brand-name Betaloc ZOK in hypertension.
Key words: hypertension, beta blockers, metoprolol succinate, Egiloc S, Betaloc ZOK, antihypertensive therapy.
