The paper focuses on the role of discogenic factor in low back pains. Diagnostic triad, i.e., non-specific pains, pains associated with serious conditions, and
compression radiculopathy, is sufficient for a general practitioner to recognize the biological component of low back pains. However, the identification of ma-
jor pain source is of crucial importance for patients with long-term or recurrent pains to develop treatment strategy which includes blockades, manual ther-
apy, and neurosurgery (as necessary). A cohort of patients with non-specific low back pains is heterogeneous. In 25-42% of patients, these pains are of disco-
genic origin. Novel effective treatment approaches provide differentiated effects on major pain source. Updated (2014) CTF classification system of lumbar
disc hernation is reviewed. Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, additional diagnostic methods, and differentiated treatment (conservative therapy and
surgery) of axial discogenic pain, one of the common manifestations of low back discogenic pathology, are described. The role of inflammation in the devel-
opment and maintenance of discogenic pains is highlighted. Ketorol use for low back pain relief is discussed.
Key words: back pain, axial discogenic pain, CTF classification system, Modic type 1, Modic type 2, inflammation in disc herniation, disc herniation treatment.
