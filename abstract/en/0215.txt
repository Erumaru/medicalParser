The article presents the algorithm of choosing the optimal antihypertensive drug for the treatment of hypertension in patients with high comorbidity (for ex-
ample, in case of hypertension combination with chronic heart failure, diabetes, nephropathy, hypertrophy of the myocardium of the left ventricle of the
heart). The article also gives a classification of arterial hypertension, describes the main groups of antihypertensive drugs with a description of their mech-
anism of action and possible side effects. Special attention is given to a non-pharmacological treatment: a psychological discharge, smoking cessation and
limited alcohol consumption, physical activity and a balanced diet. The authors described in detail the hypotensive drug from the group of blockers of AT1-
receptor of angiotensin II - candesartan (Giposart, Akrikhin company). The article presents the results of a multicenter randomized research of candesartan
in patients with hypertension, nephropathy, with diabetes mellitus and heart failure.
The aim of using the algorithm is to achieve a protective effect in respect of targeted organs. The article provides the evidence base of efficiency and safety
of candesartan. Candesartan has a good dose-dependent antihypertensive effect in all categories of patients with hypertension and can be recommended for
a wider clinical use.
Key words: blocker AT1-receptor of angiotensin II, candesartan, Geocart, hypertension, nephropathy, heart failure, myocardial infarction
