The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) remains high throughout the world and varies across Russian regions, ranging from to 65% to 86%. H.
pylori is the causative agent for a number of conditions, i.e., gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer, and MALT lymphoma. This pathogen is also recognized as
a carcinogen for gastric cancer. Hence, the most effective preventive measure for gastric cancer is H. pylori eradication. The Kyoto global consensus report
on Helicobacter pylori gastritis (September 2015) stated that eradication therapy should be recommended to all patients infected with H. pylori if there are
no contraindications (i.e., comorbidities, high reinfection probability in the population, etc.). According to the Russian and international guidelines, in areas
with low clarithromycin resistance rate (less than 15-20%), 14-day triple therapy should be prescribed as a first-line treatment. In areas with high clar-
ithromycin resistance rate, bismuth-containing quadruple therapy should be used. In non-responders to the triple therapy, bismuth-containing quadruple
therapy or 14-day levofloxacin-containing triple therapy should be considered. A double dose of proton pump inhibitor and a detailed explanation of drug
regimen may increase the efficacy of eradication treatment. 
Key words: Helicobacter pylori, eradication, peptic ulcer, gastric cancer, proton pump inhibitor.
