Urticaria has a large medical and social significance due to its high prevalence. In 15–23% of adults in the stream of life there is at 
least one episode of acute urticaria, and the prevalence of chronic urticaria (CU) varies from 0.5 to 5%. Incidence of the urticaria 
often comes in working age and patients note a marked decrease in quality of life. Mast cells are key cells in pathogenesis of 
the urticaria, they express a variety of receptors, activation of which leads to cell degranulation and release of a multitude of 
mediators, the main one, with respect to the urticaria, is histamine. Many symptoms of the urticaria are mediated by an action of 
the histamine on H1-receptors, and prolonged continuous treatment with H1-antihistamines (H1-AH) is advisable in the treatment 
of CU. The main principle of pharmacological treatment of the CU is control or complete reduction of symptoms. Modern H1-AH of 
2nd generation in licensed doses is a first-line treatment for the CU, but therapy with high doses of the H1-AH of 2nd generation 
is a second line. One of the H1-AH, most fully satisfying requirements for efficiency and safety, is levocetirizine. Pharmacological 
and clinical studies demonstrate a rapid onset of effect and a prolonged therapeutic action of the drug.
Key words: urticaria, blister, angioedema, mast cells, antihistamines, levocetirizine, Allerway.
