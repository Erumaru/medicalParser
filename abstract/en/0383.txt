Overactive bladder has an extremely negative effect on the quality of life of patients. In 2018, 546 million people worldwide were reported to 
be suffering from OAB, accounting for 20.1% of the population. Its symptoms are present in 17% of the adult population of Europe. The main 
goals of OAB pharmacological therapy are to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. The main task of treatment is to restore the lost 
control over the accumulation capacity of the bladder. The most effective and frequently used method of treatment of patients with OAB is the 
use of M-cholinergic antagonists, which differ in efficiency and safety of use. Fesoterodine (Toviaz®) improves urinary control and is a choice 
for patients with OAB, especially the elderly and at risk of cognitive or cardiovascular complications. Fesoterodine is available as prolonged 
action tablets, which allows you to prescribe it once a day. Good ratio of  efficacy and price, good tolerability, accessibility, and ease of 
administration of fesoterodine ensure a high level of patient adherence to treatment, which helps to achieve good clinical results.
