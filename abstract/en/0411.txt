Adrenocortical cancer is a rare cancer originating from adrenal cortex which is characterized by aggressive clinical course, late diagnosis, and poor clinical
outcomes. The occurrence of adrenocortical cancer is 0.5 to 2 cases per million per year. Molecular genetics of this condition remains elusive. Adrenocorti-
cal cancer is diagnosed both as a sporadic disease and as a component of some inherited syndromes. The penetrance of this disorder is low thus significant-
ly reducing the possibility to follow hereditary nature of adrenocortical cancer. For many decades, molecular studies involved little samples and investigat-
ed genes which promote the development of this disorder. It was demonstrated that elevated expression of IGF2, inactivating mutation of TP53, and activa-
tion of Wnt/b-catenin signal pathway due to the mutation of b-catenin gene are associated with adrenocortical cancer. This paper summarizes data on key
molecular genetic mechanisms of adrenocortical cancer.
Key words: adrenocortical tumors, adrenocortical cancer, molecular pathology, genetic pathology, signal pathway, inherited syndromes.
