Lower-back pain (LBP) remains an urgent problem due to its widespread. LBP is one of the most common among chronic pain 
syndromes, and the fifth most common cause of seeing a doctor.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered to be a gold standard in relieving back pain. Parenteral forms of 
administration NSAIDs (tenoxicam) to patients with dorsalgia reduces the duration of treatment, provides greater regression of 
pain and longer remissions. Tenoxicam belongs to the group of oxicams, non-selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase. It is rapidly 
absorbed since the maximum plasma concentration is reached within 2 hours after intramuscular injection (the concentration 
is 90% or higher). Bioavailability of the drug by oral administration reaches 100%. Tenoxicam has a number of advantages 
in terms of speed and duration of the effect over other oxycams. It has been shown that tenoxicam therapy is quite equal to 
corticosteroid one.
