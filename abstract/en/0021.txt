Objective. To describe a clinical case of usage of  azilsartan medoxomil (AM) in combination with chlorthalidone  (Edarbi® Clo) in patients with arterial hy-
pertension (AH) and high blood pressure (BP), insulin resistance and high risk of cardiovascular complications. Target blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg was
achieved with  Edarbi® Clo in short time with good tolerability profile. In addition to BP the drug slows the progression of metabolic disorders and  increas-
es tissue sensitivity to insulin.
Clinical case. The patient (46 y.o.) with AH reached target BP of 120/70 with combination antihypertensive therapy. The patient did not experience any ad-
verse events (dizziness, weakness, hypotension). Positive dynamics of BP (self-control and 24-h monitoring) was revealed as well as high patient's adher-
ence to prescribed treatment. The speed of BP decrease is also important due to  high risk of cardiovascular complications. 
Conclusion. Clinical case presents the patient with AH and high risk of cardiovascular complications and excellent efficacy of combined antihypertensive ther-
apy.
