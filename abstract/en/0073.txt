Since the formation «non-infectious immunology», systemic connective tissue diseases became an important model for immune 
disorders study and laboratory immunological methods were included in clinical rheumatology practice. Rheumatology was 
the place of the origin of «immunomodulating therapy» concept. At the same time, the «explosive development” of immunology 
last decades led to significant disproportions in the morphofunctional approach to the disease and produced the «declination» 
towards the immune periphery (immune cells and their products) and some disregard of central organs of immunity (thymus). 
Over the past 30–40 years, clinical immunology three times has completely updated the complex of research methods and 
approaches. Such situation greatly complicated the contact between immunologists and clinicians. The emergence of «targeted» 
therapy with genetically engineered biological means in rheumatology again actualizes the use of immunological methods in 
the clinic and poses new challenges to immunologists and clinicians.
Key words: immune system, rheumatology, autoantibodies, thymus, targeted therapy, immunogram.
