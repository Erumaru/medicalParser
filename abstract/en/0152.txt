A serious public health problem, respiratory diseases (RD, both of upper and lower respiratory tract) are characterized by high prevalence, sometimes non-
adequate and self-treatment, as well as quite high risk of complications. Acute respiratory infections, the most common diseases in ambulatory practice, take
about 90% of all infectious diseases in childhood. RD is a great problem not just because of their frequency and severity, but also due to huge economic bur-
den for individuals and society. Inhalation therapy is the most logical treatment in almost all RD, as the drug in aerosol form can be directly sent to the place
of action - respiratory tract. Currently, there are several types of delivery systems for inhaled drugs: nebulizers, metered-dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers,
etc. The paper addresses principles of operation of main types of nebulizers, describes their advantages and disadvantages. New nebulizer OMRON C300
Сomplete can be used for the treatment of obstructive diseases, as well as for respiratory infections in children and adults, due to possibility of delivering the
drug into the upper and lower respiratory tract. 
Key words: respiratory diseases, inhalation therapy, nebulizer, nebulizer OMRON C300 Сomplete.
