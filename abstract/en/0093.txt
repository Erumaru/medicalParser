Hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to the deficiency of the C1-inhibitor is an orphan disease characterized by derma deep layers’ 
and membrane mucosa’s edema development. Edema can be debilitating, it can significantly reduce patient’s quality of life and 
often lead to disability and even to death. Edema can occur both for no apparent reason, and under the influence of various 
trigger factors. Injury is one of the most common causes of edema, while there is a special group of triggers, which most often 
provoke life-threatening edema: various medical interventions such as diagnostic, dental and surgical. That is why patients with 
HAE are often denied the necessary examination or treatment due to the fear of edema, or, vise versa, medical interventions are 
provided without proper preparation, which leads to resuscitation, including tracheostomy. In addition, patients themselves are 
afraid of the edema development and reject the necessary medical care. Low awareness of medical staff about this rare disease 
worsens the situation. For today, there are some recommendations which have been developed to reduce the risk of edema. The 
introduction of these recommendations into practice allows not only to perform the required intervention without complications, 
but also to improve the quality of patient’s life.
Key words: hereditary angioedema, HAE, short-term prophylaxis, C1-inhibitor, Berinert, danazol, angioedema, bradykinin.
