The prevalence of severe cognitive impairment in the population is quite high and is increasing every year. Ordinary, it is 
difficult to classify these disorders, which is associated with a high diversity of the clinical performance and the complex 
genesis  of  neuropathological  forms  of  inhibition  of  cognitive  functions.  Currently,  dementia  of  mixed  type  ranks  third 
among  the  most  common  causes  of  cognitive  impairment.  Cerebrovascular  dysfunction  plays  an  important  and  integral 
role  in  the  development  of  not  only  vascular  dementia,  but  neurodegenerative  genesis,  emphasizing  the  common  of  both 
processes and the high importance of registration of vascular factor in the practical management of patients. In addition 
to  the  pathomorphological  changes  that  underlie  various  types  of  cognitive  disorders,  the  similarity  of  risk  factors  for 
the development of various dementia types has been repeatedly pointed out. Control of these risk factors remains the key 
strategy for the prevention of all dementia types. In the absence of clinical guidelines for the management of patients with 
mixed dementia, it seems reasonable to use medications that have proven a high level of effectiveness in patients with various 
disorders of cognitive functions.
Key words: dementia, vascular-degenerative dementia, cognitive impairment, risk factors, Cerebrolysin.
