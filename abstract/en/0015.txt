The imbalance of energy metabolism which develops early in various disorders and pathologies as a result of ischemia alters the morphology and functions
of cellular structures thus leading to apoptosis and cell death. Free radicals and reactive oxygen species characterized by high affinity for membrane lipids
and phospholipids are the key factors damaging cell membranes. Despite long-term experience with antihypoxants and antioxidants, therapeutic regimens
are still empirical but not evidence-based. Considering this, pharmacological agents which protect biological membranes (i.e., antioxidants) and improve cel-
lular energy levels (i.e., antihypoxants) are a promising treatment for abnormalities resulted from lipid peroxidation and metabolic imbalance. The key issue
of modern cardiology is myocardial protection through the activation of various metabolic processes. It is generally accepted that metabolic correction in car-
diovascular diseases (CVDs) is the most reasoned approach in terms of pathophysiology. International guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations
on the use of metabolic cytoprotective agents in coronary heart disease with chronic heart failure. The paper analyzes published data on the efficacy of meta-
bolic therapy in CVDs using taurine and presents authors’ results.
Key words: metabolic therapy, antihypoxants, antioxidants, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, taurine, Dibicor.
