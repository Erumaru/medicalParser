Increased human antimicrobial resistance is one of the key issues of modern health care. The paper addresses rational use of antimicrobials in pediatric res-
piratory infections. Clinical manifestations and the course of acute tonsillitis/pharyngitis, acute medium otitis, acute sinusitis, and pneumonia are described
in detail. The most common causative agents and antibiotics which rational use depends on comorbidities and allergic reactions are reviewed. For instance,
antibiotics are prescribed even in mild acute medium otitis if it occurs in children with immunodeficiency and/or congenital disorders. Infants under 6 months
as well as children under 2 years with bilateral acute medium otitis with otorrhea, severe earache, and febrile fever also require antibiotics. Drugs of choice
are oral amoxicillin/clavulanate or macrolides. The paper discusses treatment algorithms to reduce the rate of irrational antibiotic use thus improving an-
timicrobial resistance.
Key words: antibiotic, resistance, acute medium otitis, pneumonia, acute pharyngitis.
