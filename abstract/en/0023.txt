The processes of perception and reproduction of rhythm affect the vast areas of the auditory, motor cortex, prefrontal cortical 
areas, and also subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia, the cerebellum and others. Perception and rhythm reproduction 
are most often investigated by the results of a person’s sensomotor synchronization task performance, when a person needs 
to synchronize his/her movements with sound or visual stimulus. The review examines approaches to the study of perception 
and reproduction of rhythm, describes the current understanding of the role of various brain structures in this process, as well 
as the connection of rhythmic praxis to cognitive functions. The emphasis is on the role of the cerebellum and basal ganglia in 
the processes of auditory-motor synchronization. The last part of the review is devoted to the consideration of approaches to 
the rehabilitation of patients with various neurological pathologies (autism, strokes, parkinsonism, Huntington’s chorea, brain 
tumors)  with  the  help  of  music,  rhythmic  sound  stimulation  and  performing  tasks  for  synchronization  with  rhythm.  Motor 
rehabilitation, including with the use of music and rhythmic influences, is widely used to develop coordination and regulation of 
sensory and motor information processing, which is a necessary condition for social interaction, voice communication and, in 
general, for integration with the environment.
Key words: rhythm, tapping, auditory-motor synchronization, rhythmic praxis, cerebellum, cognitive functions, rehabilitation, 
autism, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s chorea, brain tumor.
