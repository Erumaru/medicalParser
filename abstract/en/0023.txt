Preoperative status assessment in comorbid patients performed by general practitioners is an important issue. The key issue is collective interaction between
experts in multitype hospital. The aims of the physician and cardiologist are to determine the risk of future surgery and to find methods to reduce this risk.
The list of obligatory routine preoperative examination does not always settle the issue and sometimes even harms. Unnecessary examinations provoke in-
surance company examinations due to the unjustified costs. Long examinations result in negative emotions and anxiety in patients and take a lot of doctor’s
time. We developed a methodical plan of perioperative examination performed by a cardiologist based on the recommendations of the European Society of
Cardiology (ECS) and American College of Cardiology (ACC). Laboratory and instrumental tests are reasonable when other diagnostic techniques do not pro-
vide reliable assessment of the status in terms of perioperative period. The paper addresses the algorithm of preoperative examination and therapy correc-
tion in cardiologic patients and the value of bridging treatment before invasive procedures and surgeries.
Key words: cardiac risk, cardiovascular risk, preoperative examination, comorbidity, therapy correction, bridging treatment.
