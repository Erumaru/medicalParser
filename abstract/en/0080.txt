Aim: to study the drug based on the algae oil extract (AOE) for the herpes simplex virus (HSV 1, 2) reproduction in an in vitro experiment on 
the sensitive model — the cell culture.
Patients and Methods: the study included the following actions: determination of the drug cytotoxicity on cell culture, determination of the 
drug antiviral action directly in the cells, determination of virus reproduction inhibition after drug exposure and the HSV infectious activity 
in enzyme immunoassay (ELISA).
Results: the concentrations, at which the drug does not have the cytotoxic effect on the sensitive cell line culture, were determined — 50% tissue 
cytopathic dose (TCD50/ml) was 0.0055% AOE solution. 0.001% drug concentration is TCID50/ml — the dose inhibiting the virus replication 
by 50%, giving a maximum decline by 2 lg TCID50/ml for HSV-1 («L2») and by 1.75 lg TCID50/ml for HSV-2 («VN») of virus infectious activity 
through the prophylactic regimen (1 hour before virus exposure).
Conclusion: the AOE drug inhibitory effect was established — chemotherapeutic index for AOE drug was 5.5, which indicates the drug antiviral 
activity. AOE is a new promising drug with another mechanism of action, different from the generally accepted drugs such as acycloguanosine 
drugs, for the HSV infection treatment.
