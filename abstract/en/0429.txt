The process of bronchial mucus formation and its proximal movement is one of the protective functions of the respiratory system. 
Bronchial mucus provides not only mechanical protection of the epithelium from microbes, but it also has bacteriostatic properties. 
In this situation, a symptom-oriented therapy is used to manage the most frequent manifestations of the disease. Most often, regime 
of moderate physical activity and a home care regime is recommended as the main therapy. In addition, mucolytic or antitussive 
agents are used to support the treatment process. Particular emphasis is placed on the group of mucolytics. Acetylcysteine is a 
representative of this group of drugs, which provides not only mucolytic, but also the antioxidant and antitoxic effects. Acetylcysteine 
thins the sputum, increases its volume,   contributes to its expectoration, and reduces inflammation as well. The drug has been used 
in clinical practice for more than 50 years and has not lost its value yet. Recent studies have shown its effect on bacterial biofilms, 
which contributes to its wider use in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract.
Key words: mucolytics, mucociliary clearance , antioxidants, cytoprotectors, biofilms, acetylcysteine.
