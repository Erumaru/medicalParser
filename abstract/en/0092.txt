The article describes the challenges of managing patients with allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a disease that characterized 
by IgE-mediated inflammation of the nasal mucosa developing after contact with the allergen. The late diagnosis of AR is the 
most common problem among patients, which is due to a number of aspects — low appealability on the background of a mild 
illness, no recognition of allergic symptoms by primary care doctors, lack of possibility to conduct specific allergodiagnostics 
in most of polyclinics.
In  addition,  the  article  describes  the  main  principles  of  AR  therapy  —  the  pathogenetic  approach,  complexity,  step-by-step 
treatment  and  prevention  of  the  disease.  It  is  emphasized,  that  the  role  and  place  of  different  therapy  methods  should  be 
determined by the efficacy of their use for the treatment of the symptoms and the disease as a whole, the risk of side effects and 
complications, and the cost of treatment. The article describes antihistamines, or H1-histamine blockers, as the preparations of 
the first choice in the therapy of AR. Thus, an ideal approach to the treatment of patients with AR should be individualized, with 
special attention given to identifying and excluding the AR triggers in all cases.
Key words: allergic rhinitis, histamine, H1-histamine blockers, anti-inflammatory effect, cetirizine, Cetrine.
