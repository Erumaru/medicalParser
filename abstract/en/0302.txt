Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the sebaceous glands. According to literary data, 80–85% of adolescents and young 
people are at risk of dermatosis. The highest rate of incidence is accounted for by the age of 15–16 years. In addition to skin 
lesions, the disease leads to the development of problems in the psycho­emotional sphere. All over the world, similar treatment 
regimens have been developed depending on the severity of the process.
Aim: to study the effectiveness of a new patch SERACIN COMEDOCID in the treatment of mild acne.
Patients and Methods: 20 patients with mild acne vulgaris at the age of 17–27 years old. A dermatologic examination was 
conducted visually with a simple count of eruption elements: open and closed comedones, papules, pustules and nodes, by which 
the severity of acne was determined. All patients underwent sebumetry based on photometric analysis of sebaceous spots, in 
order to objectively evaluate the clinical data. The study was performed with CUTOMETER MPA 580 CK Electronic (Germany) 
device with the adjutages for sebumetry.
Results: all patients had regression of inflammatory elements by the 3rd–4th day of application. As a result of the thera­
py (usually, it took only 2–3 days), the number of inflammatory elements (pustules) decreased from 9.5±1.4 to 0.6±0.3, 
i.e., in 10 (50%) patients with acne, complete skin cleansing was achieved, in other 10 (50%) patients — a significant im­ 
provement.
Conclusion: SERACIN COMEDOCID topical patches in combination with SERACIN cleansing gel of the company Librederm 
for the treatment of mild acne are the effective remedies, which is confirmed by the results of sebumetry and dermatoscopy. 
Patches are well tolerated by patients with acne and do not cause the development of adverse events and allergic reactions. 
Patches are also recommended to be used as SOS­agents in the presence of single elements, which ensures their regression 
by 2–3 days of use.
Key words: mild acne, SERACIN cleansing gel, SERACIN COMEDOCID patch.
