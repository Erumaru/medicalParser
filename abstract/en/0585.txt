Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is an important medical and social challenge of the 21st century. Joint and spinal disorders developing in
HIV-infected patients mimic various rheumatic syndromes. Some conditions are more common in HIV infection, i.e., HIV-associated arthritis, Reiter syndrome,
psoriasis, diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome, HIV-associated polymyositis, and other types of soft tissue disorders and joint infections. Arthralgia
is the most common symptom. One-third of these patients (usually with AIDS) are diagnosed with psoriasis which is considered a factor of unfavorable out-
come and a predictor of recurrent life-threatening infections (pneumocystis pneumonia). HIV-infected patients also suffer from severe psoriatic arthritis
characterized by erythroderma, generalized pustular psoriasis, and polyarthritis (dominant clinical manifestation). HIV-associated psoriatic arthritis is
characterized by rapid progression of joint manifestations and the correlation between skin lesions and joint damage and ineffective therapy as well. Progress
in HIV treatment allows to prescribe infliximab for resistant psoriasis and Reiter syndrome. Patients with severe or resistant psoriasis should be tested for
HIV. Patients with the debut of polymyositis should be examined for neoplasms and tested for HIV to exclude these conditions. 
Key words: HIV infection, rheumatic masks, arthropathy, psoriasis, Reiter syndrome, diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome, joint infections.
