Facial pain syndromes, caused by lesion of the trigeminal nerve system, are diverse in clinical manifestations, have severe course and chronic recurrent na-
ture. The collection of an anamnesis, in particular the description of a pain phenomenon by a patient, as well as an objective study of clinical manifestations,
makes it possible to determine firstly the level of lesion, and then the cause of the disease.
The article shows the main etiological factors, clinical manifestations of lesion of the peripheral branches of the trigeminal nerve. A description of the clinical
picture of iatrogenic lesion of the peripheral branches of the trigeminal nerve is given. The article considers the Gasser’s ganglion lesion in the cranial cavity,
basilar lesion of the root of trigeminal nerve, trigeminal nucleus lesion. Two clinical cases are described.
Thus, if a neuropathic disorder associated with a trigeminal nerve pathology is suspected in a patient with orophacial pain, a careful history and clinical ex-
amination should be performed. Having determined the topical level of the lesion, continue the diagnostic search with the help of instrumental, laboratory
and other methods of investigation.
Key words: trigeminal nerve, topical diagnosis, trigeminal pain, odontogenic pain.
