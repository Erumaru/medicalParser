Auscultatory method for determining blood pressure (BP), proposed at the beginning of the last century by a Russian surgeon 
and scientist N.S. Korotkov, is widely used now in clinical practice. It is the basis for the diagnosis of hypertension (H). To ob-
tain reliable BP values, it is necessary to comply with a number of mandatory requirements and conditions, which are set out 
in the relevant recommendations. In the light of national recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension 
and European recommendations of 2018, the article discusses current views on the classification of BP levels, the algorithm for 
screening and diagnosis of hypertension, as well as target levels of BP in various patient populations. In conditions of inade-
quate control of BP in the population, the importance of self-monitoring of blood pressure (SMBP) at home is emphasized, which 
can significantly improve patient compliance and, accordingly, the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. This method of 
BP control has a number of additional benefits over the traditional clinical measurement of BP. In turn, the information content 
of the SMBP results is predetermined by the correct measurement technique and reliability of used sphygmomanometers. Main 
requirements for modern sphygmomanometers are discussed.
Key words: BP measurement, hypertension, self-monitoring of blood pressure, varieties of sphygmomanometers, sphygmoma-
nometer.
