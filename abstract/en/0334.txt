The article analyzes the problems of organization of rehabilitation of deaf patients after cochlear and stembrain implantation. The authors determine the
conditions necessary to ensure a high effect of cochlear implantation as a high-tech method for the restoration of auditory function. There are 3 levels of in-
teraction in the process of organization of the patient’s rehabilitation: 1) the macro level (government, including ministries of health, education and social
protection), 2) meso level (cochlear implantation centers, medical and pedagogical universities), 3) microlevel (surdological / rehabilitation centers, educa-
tional institutions ). Two steps of the organization of auditory rehabilitation of children with cochlear implants are shown as a long-term process. Local
medical centers provide technical and medical support to a patient with auditory implants during his life. The present policy of the Government of the Russian
Federation and Ministry of Health in the field of promotion of modern technologies of treatment and rehabilitation of deaf children and adults is consecutive.
It is concluded that an important condition for increasing the effectiveness of auditory implantation as a medical technology is the development of a system
of psychological and pedagogical support for children with cochlear and brainstem implants on the basis of the centers of cochlear implantation and regional
surdological centers. 
Key words: deafness, cochlear implantation, auditory brainstem implantation, organization of rehabilitation of the patients after cochlear implantation.
