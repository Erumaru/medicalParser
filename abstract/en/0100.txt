Traditional medications of sulfonylurea (SU), which stimulate insulin secretion, have been edged out by incretin drugs, primarily 
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (iDPP-4) inhibitors, due to their unique physiological glucose-dependent effect on insulin and glucagon 
secretion, allowing for effective control of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) without significant side effects. Drugs of iDPP-4 class 
are recommended for use at all stages of DM development, starting from the onset, both in monotherapy and in combination 
with oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) and insulin. Cardiovascular safety, the possibility of admission at the tardive stages of 
chronic kidney disease (CKD), a neutral effect on body weight, ease of application are indisputable benefits. The combination 
of iDPP-4 (for example, vildagliptin) with metformin is the most popular, covers the vast majority of pathophysiological defects 
in type 2 DM, is available in a fixed form (for example, Galvus Met速). The admission of drugs of the iDPP-4 class in clinical 
practice for more than 10 years (e.g., Galvus速) allows to consider that their main clinical effects are finally identified, they can 
be systematized and the established benefits and disadvantages in managing of type 2 DM can be discussed.
Key words: diabetes mellitus, incretins, iDPP-4, vildagliptin, metformin, Galvus速, Galvus Met速.
