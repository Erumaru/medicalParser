Back pain is an actual and widespread condition, accompanied by a pronounced disadaptation and a decrease in the quality of life of people of the working-
age, leading to a significant socioeconomic damage in most of the developed world (up to 80% of all health costs are attributed to the treatment of chronic
back pain). The article considers the principles of diagnostics and management of patients with acute nonspecific pain in the back. An extremely important
stage in the management of this category of patients is the prompt and effective relief of an acute episode of back pain (after the elimination of potentially
dangerous diseases and / or conditions causing the pain syndrome), since this allows to increase the volume of rehabilitation measures, adequately expand
the motor regime, shorten the period of incapacity for work and prevent the chronization of the disease. The group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
is most widely used for this purpose. This group includes the selective COX-2 inhibitor nimesulide. Nimesulide (Nise®) is a highly effective, safe and well tol-
erated drug, carefully studied in numerous experimental and clinical studies and possessing a wide range of diverse influences.
Key words: back pain, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), nimesulide
