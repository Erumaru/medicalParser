Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is characterized by a continuously progressing current and frequent recurrence. The standard 
of NMIBC treatment is transurethral resection (TUR), however, the frequency of recurrences after TUR is extremely high, which, in turn, 
leads to the progression of the tumor process, excluding organ-preserving treatment methods. The problem of detecting this pathology at 
the initial stage and control of the radicality of the treatment remains extremely important today. At present, physical factors of influence 
and combinations of physicochemical methods are widely used in diagnostics and treatment of NMIBC patients, allowing selective influence 
on tumor tissue, one of them is intraoperative performance of photodynamic diagnostics and photodynamic therapy, called “photodynamic 
teranostics”. However, at the moment there is no assessment of the effectiveness of the domestic fluorescent video system with multispectral 
laser exposure. This scientific review presents information on the peculiarities of using photodynamic diagnostics and therapy of NMIBC.
