Aim: to evaluate the antihypertensive effect and safety of the drug Angiakand (“Canonpharma Production”, Russia) in patients 
with uncomplicated uncontrolled arterial hypertension (AH).
Patients and Methods: 54 patients (median of age 55 years, 37% of men) with uncomplicated previously untreated or uncontrolled 
monotherapy AH of 1–2 st., who applied for ambulatory care were included in an open, single-center study of the efficacy and 
safety of a 4-week candesartan therapy. All patients before and after the study had their clinical blood pressure (BP) and heart 
rate  measured,  also  biochemical  blood  test,  ambulatory  BP  monitoring  (ABPM),  applanation  tonometry,  echocardiography 
were made.
Results: the observation period was 4 weeks. There was a decrease in the median of systolic/diastolic blood pressure from 153/95 
to 138/89 mm Hg. (p<0.001) according to the clinical measurement and from 134/79 to 125/74 mm Hg. (p<0.001) according to 
the ABPM data. Target values of clinical BP were achieved in 33 (61%), and daily mean BP in 36 (68%) patients. Central systolic 
blood pressure decreased from 141 to 129 (p<0.001), central diastolic blood pressure — from 92 to 84 (p<0.001), central pulse 
BP — from 48 to 41 mm Hg. (p<0.05). Accurate changes in pulse wave velocity, indices of left ventricular diastolic function, 
functional state of the kidneys, electrolyte level were not established. 1 (2%) patient had a transient headache, which was not 
the reason for drug withdrawal. No other adverse reactions were reported.
Conclusion: a four-week monotherapy with the Russian medication called candesartan (Angiakand) at a dose of 16 mg/day in 
middle-aged patients with uncomplicated uncontrolled AH of 1–2 st. is accompanied by a significant decrease in both peripheral 
and central systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, differing in the high safety profile.
