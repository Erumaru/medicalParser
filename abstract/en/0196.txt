Bronchial asthma (BA) is an urgent public health problem. Treatment of asthma is based on the level of disease control. The change in the structure of basic
therapy is one of the causes of exacerbations of asthma and an increase in material costs. One of the most promising and, at the same time, the most well-
studied approaches to the treatment of persistent asthma is the use of fixed combinations of inhaled glucocorticosteroids (IGCC) and long-acting β2-agonists
(DDBA). The combination of budesonide / formoterol Turbuhaler® is recommended for both basic therapy and for relief of asthma symptoms. This dosage reg-
imen is known as SMART (Symbicort Maintenance And Reliever Therapy) or single inhaler regimen. The use of this regimen contributes to the effective res-
olution of problems in achieving asthma control: a) providing ongoing monitoring or relief of symptoms and b) reducing the risks of exacerbation of the dis-
ease. Improving the control of asthma will reduce the steroid load, reduce the number of hospitalizations and calls for emergency medical care for patients
with asthma.
