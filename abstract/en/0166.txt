Atopic dermatitis, the most common allergic disorder in children, is an important medical issue due to its chronic recurrent nature, diversity and severity of
clinical manifestations, negative impact on the quality of life, and the lack of curative treatment. Considering this, the major goals are the improvement of
treatment approaches and the development of effective preventive measures. As we extend our knowledge on the pathogenic mechanisms of atopic dermatitis
and the role of compromised skin barrier in the development and maintenance of chronic skin inflammation, it becomes clear that topical agents promoting
corneal layer reparation should be the heart of basic therapy. Moreover, recent date demonstrate that these agents are potentially effective for primary pre-
vention of atopic dermatitis. This paper reviews pathogenic role of epidermal barrier dysfunction in atopic dermatitis as well as the importance of skin care
products for the prevention and treatment of this disorder.
Key words: atopic dermatitis, skin care, emollients, treatment, prevention.
