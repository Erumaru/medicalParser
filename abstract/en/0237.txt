Cardiovascular risk reduction with decreasing morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases is considered as one of the 
main tasks of modern cardiological practice and should contribute to an increase in life expectancy in our country. Efficacy and 
safety of statins and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) have been confirmed in a large number of randomized trials. The use of statins 
and ASA in patients with a very high cardiovascular risk to reduce incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, and vascular death 
is beyond doubt. In this category of patients, the usage of fixed combinations of statins and ASA opens up new opportunities for 
improving efficacy through better compliance to treatment. However, the use of the same technologies for primary prevention in 
people with a relatively low risk of cardiovascular events raises certain doubts. The prescription of ASA and statins to patients 
without clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis in accordance with modern clinical recommendations should be strictly individual.
Key words: statins, acetylsalicylic acid, prevention of cardiovascular complications, compliance, fixed combinations.
