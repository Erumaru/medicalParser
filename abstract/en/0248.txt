Purpose: Identification of clinical and psychological features in pediatric patients with juvenile arthritis (JA) and their parents.
Methods: A comparative analysis of clinical and psychological data in 34 children aged 5 to 17 years with different types of JA was performed in pediatric
hospitals City Clinical Hosital №5 and Kemerovo Regional Clinical Hospital. VAS subjective pain assessment, sentence completion projective method, Lüscher
color test, diagnostics of child’s attitude to disease were conducted along with clinical examination. 
Results: High subjective pain scores and anxiety index were identified in children with JA of low disease activity (3,25± 2,17). Parents of patients under the
study have shown low anxiety level (0,29± 2,7), and general stress(0,01 ± 0,28). High average values of anxiety index in children with juvenile arthritis of
low disease activity are related to early age and frequent hospitalizations. Identified psychological features in children with JA and their parents require an
integrated interdisciplinary approach in terms of management of these patients.
Key words: juvenile arthritis, children, psychological status.
