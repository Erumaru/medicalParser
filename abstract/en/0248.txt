Shoulder pain is typical of various neurological and somatic disorders. It occurs in 26% of the population. Shoulder pain can be a manifestation of a serious
somatic disease, for example, oncology (Pancoast tumor, extra- and intramedullar tumors). In this cases, early diagnosis saves patient's life. Therefore, shoul-
der pain requires careful and detailed examination. The diseases of joints (shoulder, acromioclavicular, or sternoclavicular) and surrounding soft tissues are
the most common shoulder pain causes. Frozen shoulder is a clinical phenomenon manifested with pain and shoulder joint movement restriction. This chron-
ic condition results in reduced quality of life and (sometimes) severe disability. The paper describes etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treat-
ment approaches to the frozen shoulder. The role of various medications (including homeopathy), mechanisms of their action, and indications are discussed.
Key words: musculoskeletal system disorders, humeroscapular periarthropathy, frozen shoulder.
