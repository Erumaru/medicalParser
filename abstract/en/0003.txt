Acute respiratory (ARI) and acute enteric infections (AEI) rank first in the structure of morbidity and the economic losses in 
Russia and in the entire world. At the same time, the problem of the mortality of children from acute upper respiratory tract 
infections and their complications remains urgent.
The article presents current information on prevalence, epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis of ARI.
Besides ARI pathogens which selectively affect the respiratory tract, recently attention has been paid to viruses that cause also 
the symptoms of the digestive system disorders, especially vomiting and diarrhea. On the other hand, at present, we know the AEI 
pathogens, which cause also the lesions of the respiratory tract. The article presents epidemiological and clinico-pathogenetic 
features concerning these ARI and AEI data.
Currently, the problem of diagnosis and treatment of coexistent infections in children remains very urgent. The diversity and 
discovery of new respiratory viruses, their variability, the rapid formation of strains resistant to antiviral agents and modifying 
adaptive immune responses in humans, lead to an increase in the frequency of viral mixed infections, which determines the need 
to develop and implement new diagnostic and treatment algorithms.
Key words: acute respiratory infections, enteric infections, viruses, mixed infection.
