The presented article highlights current medicine urgent issues, such as musculoskeletal pain and anesthesia principles. Much attention is 
paid to nonsteroidal anti­inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which have held a firm place in medical practice. Directions in the symptomatic and 
pathogenetic pain elimination with the use of agents that block inflammatory mediators production are considered. Side effects during the 
NSAIDs application are highlighted in detail, especially as the long­term administration. The article also describes the developing complication 
risks that limit the therapeutic potential of such drugs, depending on their administration method. According to given data, in local NSAIDs 
administration,  the  likelihood  of  the  adverse  events  decreases,  and  an  adhesive  form  has  many  undeniable  benefits  and  advantages.  
An overview of drugs manufactured in the transdermal therapeutic system form containing NSAIDs is presented. Nociceptive pain treatment 
is  quite  amenable  to  NSAIDs  therapy  and  is  safer  with  the  transdermal  therapeutic  systems  application.  The  authors  conclude  that  it  is 
necessary to further develop transdermal therapeutic systems with NSAIDs of domestic production.
