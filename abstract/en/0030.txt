Intestinal gas generation is a physiological process that occurs in the body of every person, regardless of age or sex. Excessive 
intestinal gas generation may appear periodically in an absolutely healthy person. However, excessive gas generation which 
lasts for a long time can be a manifestation of either gastrointestinal or any other disease. Most often, excessive gas occurs in 
young children due to physiological processes and digestion features.
Functional digestive disorders (FDD) still occupy one of the leading places in the structure of diseases of the digestive system. 
Among FDD the most frequent disorders are abdominal pains that occur in 90% of cases, especially in young children, leading 
to the development of intestinal colic. According to the International Classification of Diseases-10, excessive gas (flatulence) is 
one of the manifestations of irritable bowel syndrome. Diagnosis of the causes of FDD is often rather difficult, which leads to 
an excessive number of unnecessary examinations, and, as a result, to irrational therapy. Most often, this situation is due to a 
lack of understanding the problem.
Key words: intestinal gas generation, bloating, intestinal colic, intestinal motility, simethicone.
