Functional dyspepsia (FD) is one of the most common gastroenterological diseases. Etiopathogenesis of FD is considered as a complex multifactorial process,
the cause-effect relations of which are still actively studied. Motor disorders (slowing evacuator function, disturbance of relaxation accommodation) and gas-
tric sensitivity (visceral hypersensitivity to stretching) are considered the main pathophysiological mechanisms of FD, underlying the generation of symp-
toms of this disease. Modern tactics of managing patients with FD, based on the Roman criteria IV (2016), regulates the strategy of differentiated use of pro-
ton pump inhibitors and prokinetics in various variants of FD, as well as the use of multipurpose therapy (Iberogast®) regardless of the clinical variant of
the disease.
Key words: functional dyspepsia, Roman criteria IV, proton pump inhibitors, prokinetics, Helicobacter pylori, eradication, Iberogast.
