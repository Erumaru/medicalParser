Summary
Scientific literature is lacking in published data on pericarditis. Meanwhile, these disorders are rather common in clinical practice. They are difficult to di-
agnose and differentiate and require different pathogenic therapy. A wide range of instrumental techniques and laboratory tests should be used to diagnose
pericarditis. The paper describes in details diagnostic potentialities of various tests, i.e., electrocardiography, echocardiography, X-ray imaging, laboratory
and other tests as well as some diagnostic algorithms. Classification of various types of pericarditis, their diagnosis and differentiation are discussed. The
principles of conservative treatment of pericarditis (including urgent therapy) are summarized. The identification of etiological factors (tuberculosis, au-
toimmune and systemic disorders) allows specific treatment. In frequent recurrences, balloon pericardiotomy or pericardiectomy should be considered. The
paper reviews the diagnosis and treatment of acute, chronic, and recurrent pericarditis. The principles of diagnosis of chronic and recurrent pericarditis are
similar to that of acute pericarditis. Diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for postinfarction pericarditis (epistenocardiac pericarditis and Dressler's syn-
drome), cardiac tamponade, constrictive and effusive-constrictive pericarditis are described as well. 
Key words: pericarditis, myopericarditis, postinfarction syndrome, non-hormonal anti-inflammatory drugs, pericardial tap, constriction, tamponade.
