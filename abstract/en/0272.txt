This  article  examines  the  population  aging  problem  as  one  of  the  demographic  aspects  affecting  osteoporosis  incidence  and  the  health 
care system measures aimed at preventing the bone mineral density reduction and low­energy fractures occurrence. A forecast average 
variant of the Federal State Statistics Service about the population estimated number and structure in the Russian Federation until 2035 
was studied. According to the above mentioned, the proportion of elderly people in the population will reach 30.1% against the background 
of the predicted increase in life expectancy in our country up to 77.13 years. The future demographic aging problem is a concern for the 
medical community since an increase in the incidence of elderly age diseases is expected. The article deals with the Federal Clinical Guidelines 
“Pathological  fractures  leading  to  osteoporosis  complications”  and  starting  drug  prevention  of  recurrent  low­energy  fractures  using  the 
ossein­hydroxyapatite complex. On January 1, 2019, the Federal Project “The Older Generation” became effective. It involves significant 
allotments for improving medical care for older citizens.
Keywords: osteoporosis, demography, population aging, population size, low­energy fractures, ossein­hydroxyapatite complex, Osteogenon.
