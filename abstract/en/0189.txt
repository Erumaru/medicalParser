Viral respiratory infections have a common nature and take up to 90% of all infectious diseases in Russia. Of these, about 20% are influenza 
viruses. Acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) and influenza usually cause exacerbation of concomitant chronic diseases such as asthma, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic hepatitis or kidney failure, diabetes or cardiovascular disorders. In addition, these pathologies 
can  cause  severe  complications.  Thus,  this  requires  an  effective  therapy  to  reduce  the  risk  of  chronic  diseases  complications  and  their 
exacerbations. Currently, there are a large number of marketed drugs recommended for ARVI treatment and prevention, which indicates the 
difficulties of creating highly effective drugs.
In this regard, the possibility of using Nobazit® (enisamium iodide) in high-risk patients with developing complications (during or after the 
influenza course) is considered at the time of searching for new drugs. Nobazit® has a number of advantages over the other preparation 
groups. It has not only a direct antiviral effect but also an anti-inflammatory, immunostimulating, analgesic effect.
