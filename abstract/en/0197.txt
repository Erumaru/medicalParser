The article considers the statements of the program of the state guarantees for the provision of free medical care to the citizens on the basis of medical as-
sistance standards, clinical recommendations, lists of medicines. The state guarantees free drug provision of the citizens in medical settings with medicines
from the Vital and Essential Drugs List. However, a number of by-laws regulate the requirement to comply with the standards of medical care and clinical
recommendations. Normative acts of the Federal Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund regulate the examination of the medical care quality, including com-
pliance with standards of medical care and clinical recommendations. Federal laws also regulate the carrying out expert examination of state and depart-
mental medical quality and safety control. According to these legal acts, compliance by medical organizations with the standards of medical care is a manda-
tory requirement. But if the provisions of all federal regulatory legal acts are observed, the physician has the right to prescribe to the patient any medica-
tions based on the tasks of the medical process and the patient's state of health.
Key words: standards of medical care, clinical recommendations, medicines.
