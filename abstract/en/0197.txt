Over the past decade our knowledge of the human intestinal microbiocenosis has significantly expanded and deepened. Currently, more than 70,000 species
of microorganisms inhabiting the large intestine and performing vital functions are known. The important role of intestinal microbes in the development of
many diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, type II diabetes, atherosclerosis, autism and multiple sclerosis has
been established. In this regard, prevention of dysbiosis and its correction seem to be important tasks in the treatment of these diseases, which are solved not
only by prescribing pre- and probiotics. Dysbiosis is always a secondary disorder, so finding a significant state in its development or disease with subsequent
correction is an important task. Correction of dysbiotic disorders should begin with the elimination of the cause.
Pro- and prebiotics are prescribed in combination with antibacterial drugs. One of these drugs is nifuratel, which has shown its effectiveness and safety both
in children and adults in numerous domestic and foreign studies. An important feature of nifuratel is that it promotes an increase in the number of bifi-
dobacteria and lactobacilli, having a broad spectrum of action, suppressing the growth of opportunistic microflora of the intestine.
Key words: intestinal microflora, dysbiosis, small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome (SBBOS), prebiotics, probiotics, nifuratel.
