This lecture for endocrinologists and general practitioners discusses infectious diseases in diabetics. Results from large clinical trials which demonstrate high-
er incidence of various infections and carriage in diabetics are addressed. Clinical value and infection course in diabetes resulting in higher mortality,
greater risks, and chronicity are uncovered. The paper analyzes the mechanisms of anti-infection protection in diabetics which breaks under hyperglycemia
as well as pathogen spectrum. Key diagnostic aspects and treatment approaches to the most common infections in diabetics are reviewed. Bacterial and fun-
gal urinary infections (including those in pregnant women), mucormycosis, soft tissue and wound infections, pneumonia, and tuberculosis are of special im-
portance. Basic antimicrobial regimens for infections of various localization and severity are described in detail. Specific early vaccination provided by en-
docrinologist is required in diabetics.
Key words: diabetes, infections, hyperglycemia, urinary tract infections, pyelonephritis, tuberculosis, antibacterial therapy, vaccination.
