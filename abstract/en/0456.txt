Chronic prostatitis is the most common cause of recurrent urinary tract infections in men. The main cause of the development of chronic prostatitis is a vio-
lation of microcirculation in the prostate gland and drainage of its acini. Antibiotic therapy is effective during the treatment, but it is sometimes unreliable in
the long term. As a result, the problem of recurrence of prostatitis remains unresolved. The methods of treatment that lead to the better blood circulation in
the prostate include α-adrenoblockers, prostate massage, physiotherapy, testosterone preparations, cytomedins.
Cytomedines are peptides, a unique class of drugs. The use of prostatic cytomedines leads to the restoration of hemodynamics of the prostate gland, the
elimination of edema and inflammation, decrease of the clinical manifestations of prostatitis, and improves the quality of the ejaculate. They increase
detrusor tone, regulate detrusor by influencing the rhythm of spontaneous contractile activity. Prostatic peptides do not have toxic or mutagenic effects. The
prostatic cytomedines preparation Vitaprost, presented in various dosage forms, is widely used in the treatment of chronic prostatitis.
Key words: chronic prostatitis, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, CPPS, cytomedines, Vitaprost, α-adrenoblockers, testosterone, prostate massage.
