As  the  large-scale  Russian  epidemiological  study  NATION  has  shown,  the  actual  number  of  patients  with  type  2  diabetes 
mellitus (DM2) in Russia is at least 8â€“9 million people (about 6% of the population). Hypogonadism in men is a clinical and 
biochemical syndrome associated with a low level of testosterone, as well as insensitivity of the receptor apparatus to androgens. 
It was shown that testosterone levels in men with DM2 are lower than in healthy people by an average of 2.5 nmol/L, and the 
prevalence of hypogonadism DM2 patients is higher than in the general population by 50%. Therefore, it is now recommended 
for all patients with DM2 and obesity to determine the level of testosterone and to decide on the appointment of testosterone 
replacement therapy (TRT), one of the modern representatives of which is gel Androgel. Since testosterone takes an active 
part in the regulation of fat and carbohydrate metabolism, the question of improving the parameters of carbohydrate and fat 
metabolism against the background of TRT in men with DM2 and confirmed hypogonadism remains topical.
Key words: type 2 diabetes, testosterone, substitution therapy, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, Androgel.
