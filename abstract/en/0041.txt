Currently, the mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including coronary heart disease (CHD), is still high in Russia. Modern management strate-
gies for CHD include surgery, complex pharmacotherapy, and alternative treatment. The paper discusses some aspects of complex pharmacotherapy in sta-
ble CHD. In particular, antiplatelet drugs, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, nitrates, calcium antagonists, ivabradine, nico-
randil, ranolazine, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and antioxidants have an significant role in complex treatment. Mineral nutrients are of special importance
for cardiovascular regulation. Magnesium deficiency alters cardiovascular system functions and results in heart rhythm disorders, high blood pressure, and
thrombosis. Decrease in intracellular magnesium leads to insulin resistance which is the component of metabolic syndrome. Magnesium orotate/Magnerot,
organic salt, is one of the most popular drugs in Russia.
Key words: coronary heart disease, stable coronary heart disease, complex therapy, magnesium orotate, Magnerot.
