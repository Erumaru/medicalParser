Rosacea (synonyms: acne, acne rosacea, gutta rosacea, cuperose, teleangiectasiasis faciei) is one of the most common skin conditions which prevalence
ranges from 0.5% to 10%. This disease ranks 7th among skin disorders. Specific etiology of rosacea still remains an enigma, however, this pathology is mul-
tifactorial and includes both underlying inherited predisposition and exposure to exogenous factors. The paper addresses epidemiology, pathogenesis, grad-
ing system, clinical course, and diagnosis of rosacea. Clinical manifestations are described in details and illustrated with photos.
Rosacea-like conditions are discussed as well. Despite multiple publications, their nosological independence, etiology, and pathogenesis are still unknown.
The treatment of rosacea is challenging. A variety of strategies were developed, however, the disease is difficult to treat. Novel drug and physiotherapy modal-
ities are needed. Rosacea is an important medical and social issue since these patients maintain their work capacity but have to be on outpatient and even in-
patient treatment for a rather long time.
Key words: rosacea, erythema, telangiectasia, Demodex, rhinophyma, rosacea-like conditions.
