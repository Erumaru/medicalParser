Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common in outpatient musculoskeletal pain syndromes. LBP problem has been turned from exceptionally 
medical to socio-economic, since the presence of this syndrome is associated with high temporary disability and direct/indirect material costs. 
Patient treatment with LBP is aimed at pain syndrome relief in order to ensure the highest possible level of daily activity and improve the patient’s 
life quality. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are in most common use for the patient treatment with LBP. In this regard, the drug choice 
is determined not only by its effectiveness but also by the pain syndrome nature and properties, as well as by additional therapy effects that 
contribute to the patient early recovery. Besides, it is necessary to consider the range of possible therapy adverse events. The article describes 
an individualized therapy approach to the patient with LBP exemplified by Ketonal® and Kostarox® drugs. The article also provides information 
justifying the prescription appropriateness of a muscle relaxant Sirdalud to the patients with LBP. This preparation has the ability to eliminate the 
striated muscles’ excessive tension.
Keywords: low back pain, ketoprofen, Ketonal, etoricoxib, Kostarox, tizanidine, Sirdalud.
