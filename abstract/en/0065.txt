The article briefly summarizes the general ideas about biorhythms of the organism. Particular attention is paid to the importance of alternative interaction
of the body's reactions in the formation of biorhythms. The necessity of their inclusion in the development of methods for treating diseases is substantiated.
The article considers the mechanisms of development of arterial hypertension (AH), in particular, special attention is paid to primary arterial hypertension
(PAH). PAH is most often found in adolescence, when there is a neuroendocrine alteration of the body, its vegetative reactivity changes. The problem of
treatment and prevention of hypertension is described in detail in the literature. Much attention is paid to the ways of changing the lifestyle, the use of non-
drug therapies, the choice of antihypertensive drugs (AHD). At the same time, it is necessary to achieve the maximum therapeutic effect with minimal doses
of AHD. This is possible with the use of the chronotherapy method, taking into account the biorhythms of the body. Chronotherapy of AH helps to get a more
pronounced therapeutic effect with a smaller dose of AHD, it focuses on an individual approach to the treatment of patients, which is especially important in
pediatrics.
Key words: adults, adolescents, arterial hypertension, biorhythms, desynchronosis, chronotherapy.
