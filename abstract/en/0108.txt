A thousand-year human experience of alcohol consumption in different regions independently of each other as well as eating 
fermenting  fruits  that  contain  ethanol  among  most  animals  indicate  its  specific  biological  value.  The  fact  that  endogenous 
ethanol is constantly present in the human body prove that this chemical compound is not extraneous for human nature, but it 
plays an active role in metabolism. Frequently found in literature simplified beliefs of alcohol as a pure evil and as a significant 
ethiopathogenetic risk factor for severe somatic and psychosocial diseases is a wrongful view. The study presents current data 
on the beneficial effect of alcohol on the cardiovascular system, harmful effects of heavy alcohol consumption; the prevalence 
of  alcoholic  heart  disease  and  pathophysiologic  mechanisms  for  its  development,  clinical  manifestations  of  each  stage  of 
development. The survey highlights the importance of diagnosis of cardiomyopathy at early and reversible stages.
Nevertheless, it should be emphasized once more that the term «struggle with alcoholism» cannot be substituted for the term 
«fighting with alcohol». History shows that such substitution has no future and there is no sense due to biological, traditional, 
religious and other factors. Moderate alcohol consumption must be the indispensable condition.
Key words: alcohol, heart, cardiovascular diseases, cardiomyopathy, clinical picture, diagnosis.
