Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common ENT disorders. The occurrence of acute rhinosinusitis increases both in outpatients and inpatients. Despite
the progress in medicine, the importance of this diseases is steadily growing for a number of reasons. In the first hours and days, topical treatment is of cru-
cial importance since it rapidly reduces inflammation and cures the disease. As a result, no systemic antibacterial agents are required. Colloidal silver prod-
ucts form protective film coating on the inflamed mucosa since silver molecules bind protein molecules. Industrial (or available) protargol resolved the issues
of its clinical use. The paper summarizes clinical trials, major causative agents of acute rhinosinusitis, and some aspects of treatment efficacy in outpatient
and inpatient departments. Key management approaches, systemic antibacterial therapy, and the importance of topical treatment are discussed.
Key words: acute rhinosinusitis, topical therapy, protargol, outpatient treatment.
