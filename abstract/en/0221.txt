Osteoporosis is an important issue of modern health care due to its high occurrence, risks of disability and death from complications. Major clinical mani-
festation of this disorder is bone fractures even after minimal injury (low-energy fractures). Every fracture significantly reduces the quality of life thus in-
creasing health care costs. Considering progressive population ageing, economic costs of osteoporosis will continue to grow.
Reduced quality of osteoporotic bone tissue results from various factors. Among them, the deficiency of vitamin D and its active metabolite, D-hormone, is of
particular importance since vitamin D is the key regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. In addition, vitamin D deficiency results in neuromuscu-
lar conduction block and reduced muscle mass thus increasing the risk of falls.
The paper discusses biological effects of alphacalcidol, active metabolite of vitamin D, and its potential use for osteoporosis therapy.
Key words: osteoporosis, treatment, vitamin D3, alphacalcidol.
