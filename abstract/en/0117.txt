Surgical correction of the heart valves makes urgent the problem of postoperative anemia, which can have a different character. 
The course of the postoperative period in such patients largely depends on the possibility of developing the acquired mechanical 
hemolytic  anemia.  In  connection  with  the  improvement  of  the  methodology  of  surgical  interventions,  as  well  as  with  the 
modernization of prosthetic heart valve (HV), cardiovascular risk in heart operations during the last decades has significantly 
decreased in all age groups. Using a new generation of prostheses has reduced the frequency of hemolytic anemia to 1%. In 
modern conditions, the most frequently expressed signs of hemolysis are caused by the prosthesis dysfunction, for example, due 
to the formation of para-valvular fistula. The destruction of erythrocytes with the development of hemolysis is associated with a 
violation of blood flow through the defective prosthesis and an increased damage to erythrocytes by the valves. The syndrome of 
mechanical hemolysis is confirmed by the detection the fragments of erythrocytes (Fragmentes Red Cell (FRC)) or schistocytes 
in the patient’s blood smear.
Key words: anemia, prosthetic heart valves, cardiovascular surgery, postoperative anemia, mechanical hemolysis, schistocytes.
