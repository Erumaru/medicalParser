Herpesviruses are widely spread among the human population. After the primary infection, the herpesviruses become latent 
and persistent in the human body for life. Adverse conditions and a low local or systemic immunity may reactivate the infection, 
which causes the inflammation, usually at the local level. The variety of clinical forms of herpesviruses infections constantly 
supports scientific interest both in the field of studying their pathophysiology and in the search for effective antiviral therapy. 
This is especially important for β- and γ-herpesviruses, since the α-herpesvirus group has been studied rather well.
Aim:  to  determine  the  efficacy  of  valacyclovir  for  replication  of  the  Epstein-Barr  virus  (EBV),  human  herpesvirus  type  6 
(HHV-6), cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the oropharynx in frequently ill adults with chronic inflammatory diseases of the upper 
respiratory tract.
Patients and Methods: 80 patients with frequent recurrences of chronic inflammatory diseases of the upper respiratory tract were 
examined outpatiently. All patients underwent microbiological examination of swabs from the oropharynx and the viral load in 
mixed saliva and whole blood not in exacerbation period was assessed. Patients received valacyclovir therapy according to the 
scheme 500 mg x 3 times a day for 14 days. Control of viral load in the biomaterial was carried out after the end of treatment.
Results and Discussion: out of the period of exacerbation the oropharynx microflora in frequently ill adults is represented 
mainly by a normal or conditionally pathogenic microflora. EBV DNA, HHV-6, but not CMV DNA, were detected in the mixed 
saliva. The DNA of the herpesvirus was not detected in the blood samples of these patients. The use of valacyclovir in a dose  
of 500 mg 3 times a day significantly reduces the replication of EBV in the oropharynx in frequently ill adults.

Conclusions: it is advisable to conduct further studies to determine the dosage regimen and evaluate the clinical efficacy of 
acyclic nucleosides in the treatment of EBV infection.
