Summary
According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) still remain the leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Hyper-
tension is the key risk factor of the development and progression of CVDs. Hypertension which was diagnosed in one billion patients results in myocardial
infarction in 45% of cases and acute ischemic stroke in 51% of cases. Hypertension is referred to as a “silent killer”. It provokes many conditions which are
considered as an actual social and medical issue. ESC Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension (2013) recommend to tailor drug choice to the
clinical characteristics of patients and comorbidities. Beta blockers are one of the most ambiguous antihypertensive drugs. Currently, these medications are
prescribed depending on the cardiovascular continuum of the patient. Thus, at the early stages, the use of beta blockers is not advisable. However, as car-
diovascular risks increase, beta blockers are considered as first-choice drugs. The paper reviews evidence-based data on beta blockers use in hypertension.
Key words: arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, beta blockers.
