The article is devoted to the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and the role of biomarkers in the diagnosis 
and asssessing of the severity of the disease. IPF is a special form of chronic progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of 
unknown etiology. It is shown that IPF is a disease of the pulmonary epithelium, which manifests itself as fibrosis, i. e.it is 
caused by dysfunction of the pulmonary epithelium. The theory of the three-stage development of the IPF is considered. From 
a diagnostic and differential diagnostic point of view, at suspicion on IPF it is important to determine the level of serum SP-A. 
The diagnostic role of other biomarkers (evaluated in these studies) is not established. When determining the prognosis, IPF 
can have the value of IL-8, the level of which correlates with the severity of the disease. Studies have shown that the serum 
biomarkers SP-A, MMP-7 and KL-6 can play a diagnostic and prognostic role for IPF patients. An inverse relationship was 
found between the concentration of biomarkers MMP-7 and KL-6 and the prognosis of 5-year survival in patients with IPF. 
Diagnostic and prognostic significance of biomarkers in IPF patients can be established only taking into account clinico-
anamnestic, radiological and, in some cases, morphological methods of investigation.
Key words: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pathogenesis, biomarkers.
