In the recent years ammount of physicians using serological tests for immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) in food allergy diagnosis is on the rise. Many patients believe
that their symptoms are caused by food allergy which makes IgG4 testing commercially attractive for private practice. This expensive test may generate sub-
stantial income, considering the number of patients reporting “food allergy”. The most common approach is blood serum IgG4 measurement to a wide range of
foods and it is used both, in paediatric and adult practice. Active use of this method in clinical practice is the main reason behind this paper write-up. 
Despite detection of high levels of IgG4 they show clinical relevance in extremely rare circumstances. IgG4 presence is a normal physiological response to a
systematic contact with a particular food product but does not represent a sign of atopy/allergy. 
At present, there is no evidence base in support of this method use in food allergy diagnosis. There is also no data to consider IgG4 active involvement in
mechanisms related to food intolerance. Therefore, this method is not recommended for use in diagnosis of food allergy and/or intolerance, as summarised
in a number of consensus papers which makes a basis for this manuscript.
