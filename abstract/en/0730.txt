Aim: To study the contribution of NAT2 gene alleles and genotypes frequency to the character of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) and the frequency of relapse and exacerbation of the disease.
Patients and Methods: the total of 120 people were examined, including 90 patients with COPD and 30 somatically healthy 
individuals as a control group. We analyzed the frequencies of genotypes and alleles of the NAT2 gene, depending on the stage 
of the disease, the frequency and duration of exacerbations and forms of COPD.
Results and Discussion: It was found that the most common genotype among the subjects was S/S genotype, F/F genotype 
was the least common among patients with COPD, with the differences between patients with COPD and somatically healthy 
individuals in the frequency of genotypes (S/S, S/F, F/F) and alleles (S, F) being statistically insignificant. Statistically significant 
differences were found in the comparison of the NAT2 gene and allele frequencies between patients with different degrees of 
COPD  severity  and  somatically  healthy  subjects.  A  statistically  significant  increase  in  carriers  of  the  S/F,  F/F  and  S  allele 
genotypes was found in patients with COPD with bronchitis compared to emphysema.
Conclusions: distribution of the NAT2 gene genotypes and alleles in patients with COPD depends on severity of the disease; the 
analysis of the combined genotypes made it possible to identify the association of some polymorphisms of the NAT2 genes with the 
development and progression of COPD; the relationship between the frequency of polymorphic alleles of the NAT2 gene with the 
frequency of relapses and the nature of COPD exacerbation; an increase in the carriers of the S/F, F/F and S allele genes among 
patients COPD with bronchitis compared with emphysema.
Key words: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, NAT2 gene, genotypes (S/S, S/F, F/F), alleles (S, F), bronchitis, emphysema.
