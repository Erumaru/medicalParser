Summary
Currently, facial neuropathy is a very common disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Relatively high incidence of facial nerve affection is accounted for
its topography and anatomy. The key etiological factors of facial neuropathy are inflammation, iatrogenic and traumatic damage. Clinical symptoms of fa-
cial neuropathy are well-known. Their severity depends on the level of the lesion. Treatment approach to facial neuropathy includes both surgical and ther-
apeutic methods.
Neurobion® contains a complex of B vitamins, i.e., pyridoxine (B6), thiamine (B1), and cyanocobalamine (B12) which have been recognized as coenzymes play-
ing an important role in the intermediary metabolism in the central and peripheral nervous system. Many clinical trials involving Neurobion® were performed.
Randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study performed by Schwieger G. demonstrated less relapses of neuropathy (spinal pain syndrome) in the
treatment (Neurobion® )group as compared with the placebo group (32% vs. 60%).
Systemic pharmacotherapy plays the most important role in the treatment of facial neuropathy. It should be personalized and be prescribed depending on the
stage of the disease and surgical procedures or physiotherapeutic methods. 
Key words: neuropathy, facial neuropathy, vitamin therapy, Bell's palsy.
