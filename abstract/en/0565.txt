Currently, stereotactic biopsy is a widespread minimally invasive intervention in neurosurgical practice. It is performed in pathological voluminous formations
inaccessible for open surgical interventions or in the case of a high risk of complications during anesthesia.
Histological diagnosis is crucial for building the right treatment plan (radiation therapy, chemotherapy) and determining the prognosis of the disease. The
success of the stereotactic biopsy depends on the state of the stereotaxic apparatus, the modern specialized software for determining the coordinates of the
target and the careful step-by-step execution of the algorithm for performing this manipulation.
The work describes in detail the indications for a stereotactic biopsy, the technique of its implementation, and the factors that influence the success of the
study. Clinical examples of patients, examined and operated in MIBS, with various pathological processes of the brain are presented.
An analysis of the work has shown that stereotactic biopsy of pathological formations of the brain is a safe and effective method of diagnosis.
The data obtained correspond to the data of large neurosurgical centers. The diagnostic reliability of a stereotactic biopsy is 93-96%.
Key words: stereotactic biopsy, stereotaxic biopsy of brain tumors, brain tumor, encephalitis, primary CNS lymphoma, radio necrosis, Leksell Stereotactic
System®, immunohistochemical study, brain biopsy technique.
