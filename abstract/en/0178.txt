At present, it is reasonably to consider the strategy of a differentiated approach to the pharmacotherapy of pain taking into account structural changes, pain
mechanisms, the choice and methods of administration of medications. The method of the pain syndrome treatment should be based on measures that include
a correct evaluation of the duration, severity of pain, accompanying symptoms, the presence of affective disorders, clarification of previous experience in the
treatment of pain syndrome, etc. It is also necessary to audit the pathophysiological mechanisms of pain before the therapy. After analyzing all the stages,
it is possible to compile an individual therapy algorithm for each patient. At the same time, many doctors traditionally use a number of drugs with a proven
clinical efficiency. Since it is not possible to adequately suppress back pain with a single drug in all cases, currently the main principle of treating back pain
is a rational polypharmacotherapy. The article discusses in detail the data on the clinical efficacy and safety of dexketoprofen preparations of trometamol
and nimesulide, and also shows one of the most effective regimens of step therapy: the consistent use of Flamadex ® and Nemuxlex ® drugs.
Key words: back pain, NSAIDs, dexketoprofen, nimesulide.
