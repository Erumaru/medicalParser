Allergic reactions to Hymenoptera venom are characterized by great severity and rapidity of the development of life-threatening symptoms. 
In Russia, no diagnostic products for allergy skin tests are approved, therefore, laboratory tests are of special importance. This paper reviews 
the most common available methods for clinical and laboratory allergy diagnostics. The features and difficulties in clinical diagnosis as well 
as the relevance of in vitro tests are discussed using Hymenoptera venom allergy example. Current progress in molecular allergy testing 
(component-based IgE allergy testing) based on numerous European and Russian studies is addressed. The paper describes domestic advances 
in the development of molecular allergy testing in Hymenoptera venom allergy. The importance and significance of additional functional in 
vitro tests (i.e., basophil activation test) are discussed. Basophil activation test performance using various identification molecules (CD63 and 
CD203c) and their diagnostic potential in Hymenoptera venom allergy (in particular when clear clinical and anamnestic data are scarce and 
specific IgE levels are irrelevant) are highlighted.
Keywords: bee, wasp, allergy, venom, Hymenoptera, allergy diagnostics, molecular allergy testing, basophil activation test.
