Anthroponotic viral infections with aerosol transmission are a large nosologic group. Among them are measles, rubella, mumps, and chicken-
pox. Currently, these infections are common in adults who are more likely than children to have severe symptoms. Viral infections especially 
those involving skin may trigger or exacerbate allergic disorders.
Aim: to analyze herd immunity to measles, rubella, mumps, and chickenpox in 93 healthy individuals aged 18–30 years.
Patients and Methods: 93 accidentally enrolled healthy individuals aged 18–30 years were examined. Blood serums were examined for pro-
tective antibodies against measles, rubella, mumps, and chickenpox viruses by ELISA using relevant test systems.
Results: protective levels of antibodies against rubella, chickenpox, and mumps were detected in most individuals (96%, 87% and 87%, re-
spectively) thus indicating the efficacy of vaccination or prior infection. Average levels of specific antibodies against rubella, mumps, and 
chickenpox were higher than protective levels. 56% of individuals were found to be seronegative for measles and 13% had residual specific 
antibodies less than protective levels. Therefore, 68% had no protection against measles. On average, 68% of individuals were susceptible to 
measles. This rate does not satisfy the criterion of epidemiological welfare.
Conclusion: our findings demonstrate that this group of individuals has low susceptibility to rubella, mumps, and chickenpox. Individuals 
without protection from measles have high risk of the infection and spread of the infection.
