Physiological anxiety is a signal of the threatening changes ongoing in the body or the external world. Its purpose is adaptation and mobilization of the or-
ganism for a rapid change in behavior and adaptation to the new conditions of existence. Pathological anxiety does not carry an adaptive resource, it has a
biological genetic basis, but it is closely connected to the external factors (level, novelty and significance of stress, social support, socio-cultural aspects,
style of upbringing, etc.).
The child's mental development is characterized by alternation of the stable and crisis stages. The behavioral disorders in children often coincides with the
beginning of attendance of organized children's groups, when children experience significant stresses on two important regulatory systems of the body -
nervous and immune. The presence of aggravating factors in the peri- and postnatal periods promotes the emergence of behavioral and emotional disorders
in combination with expressed vegetal symptoms.
Soothing agents that can be used in pediatric practice are represented by preparations of plant and synthetic origin. From the point of view of efficiency and
safety balance, Tenoten for children is an appropriate behavior corrector that regulates the work of the central nervous system and combines calming vege-
tative stabilizing and adaptogenic action. The article gives an overview of the clinical studies of this drug.
Key words: anxiety, excitement, age-related periodization, behavioral disorders, vegetative disorders, Tenoten for children.
