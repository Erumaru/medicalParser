The formation of surgical scar involves external and internal factors and includes exudation and inflammation phases, proliferation, reorganization. There
are no reliable reasons for the development of hypertrophic and keloid scars at the present time. Their formation is based on the violations in the synthesis
and degradation of collagen at various stages of scar development. Pathological scars can appear at any age, but most often they occur in young patients.
Rational tactics of treating pathological scars include therapeutic, physiotherapeutic, radiological, surgical and cosmetic methods. The multicomponent
drugs affecting various stages of scar formation process are very effective. The measures aimed at prevention of keloid scars include the minimally invasive
treatment methods that reduce skin damage and the use of various therapeutic and physiotherapeutic agents that impede the formation of keloid tissue.
Key  words: collagen,  fibroblasts,  metalloproteinases,  peeling,  mesotherapy,  dermabrasion,  endothelioprotective  effect,  proliferation,  conjugated
hyaluronidase.
