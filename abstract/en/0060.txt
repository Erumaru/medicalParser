This study provides data about the importance of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein in the development of pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal
dysplasia, which prove that the most common causes of pseudoachondroplasia are mutations in the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, which confirm a ge-
netic predisposition to the disease. In multiple epiphyseal dysplasia the determination of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein provides the differential diagnosis
in order to identify skeletal dysplasias in children with unexplained nerve symptoms. 
It is suggested that there are phenotypic overlaps between pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, which are proved by the identification
of gene mutations in the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. The analysis of the data presented in the review confirms that there are common pathogenetic
mechanisms underlying the two clinically related achondroplasias, pseudochondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.
The results of our own studies and published data justify the advisability of including cartilaginous oligomeric matrix protein into the metabolic homeostasis
assessment  of children with undifferentiated connective tissue dysplasia, as an up-to-date biological marker of the cartilage tissue metabolism, along with
other indicators characterizing the metabolic state of the body.
Key words: cartilaginous oligomeric matrix protein, undifferentiated connective tissue dysplasia, children.
