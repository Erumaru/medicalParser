This review contains data on the vitamin D participation in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension (AH). Data on vitamin 
D regulation of the formation of renin in the juxtaglomerular kidney apparatus are presented. It is noted, that local renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone systems (RAAS) play more important role in the formation of pathophysiological disorders in AH than 
circulating RAAS. Attention is focused on the interaction of local RAAS and paracrine factors, in particular TGF-beta factor 
(TGF-β), at the endothelium level. The experimental and therapeutic effects of vitamin D, including its native forms, active 
metabolites and vitamin D receptor activators are analyzed. Given the prevalence of the diseases associated with vitamin D 
deficiency, it is necessary to introduce screening tests to detect the deficit of this vitamin in the population. With receiving the 
new data on the pathogenesis of AH formation, additional prognostic criteria of the disease appear, allowing the development 
of  innovative  approaches  to  its  therapy,  for  example,  the  use  of  vitamin  D  preparations  and  its  metabolites  to  correct  the 
development of hypertension, including AH in the metabolic syndrome.
Key words: vitamin D, renin, aldosterone, angiotensin, TGF-beta factor (TGF-β), adiponectin.
