In this article we would like to pay attention to the problems that a general practitioner may face when observing a patient after cerebrovascular accident at
an outpatient stage. The problem of rehabilitation after a stroke is as urgent and important as the issue of saving a patient's life in the acute period of cere-
brovascular accident (CVA). The effectiveness of rehabilitation after a stroke depends on the observance of a number of conditions: an individual orientation
of the impact, a strict dosage, a gradual increase in the intensity of the impact, continuity and phase. In an acute period rehabilitation activities begin in the
primary vascular centers, which is very important for achieving the best results of restoring the lost functions. The article considers in detail the problems of
rehabilitation of post-stroke depression, spasticity, shoulder pain, urination disorders, vascular cognitive impairment and post-stroke dementia. The issues
of patient nutrition, nutritional support and sipping are discussed separately. 
Key words: medical rehabilitation, spasticity, post-stroke pain in the shoulder, sinking, cognitive impairment, depression, urinary disorders.
