The article presents data on the current problem of the drug therapy of patients with reduced myocardial contractility, which 
has a proven positive effect on patients’ survival, for solving the health issues of the country’s population. It is shown, that in 
the conditions of the limited funds allocated to medical institutions for providing free treatment, it is important to use only those 
means that have a proven positive effect on retaining the working capacity and life expectancy. A critical assessment is made 
of the unreasonable way of using the allocated funds and personal money of patients. As the evidence of the most rational 
management of such patients, the authors use and compare the data presented almost simultaneously (in 2016 and 2017) in 
the USA and Europe in the Guidelines for the treatment of patients with heart failure with reduced myocardial contractility. 
Comparative analysis shows the incompleteness of the current ideas about the ways of treating such patients. It demonstrates 
the importance of agreements on the need to develop common criteria for assessing the effectiveness of the means used to treat 
patients. Today, the principles, underlying the «evidence-based medicine», require substantial clarification.
Key words: heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction, heart failure treatment, evidence-based medicine, life expectancy, 
nicorandil.
