In the modern world, the conditions of human life lead to reducing the time of physical activity of a person. It has been 
proved, that sedentary lifestyle results in an increased obesity among population, it is also considered to be a risk factor 
for  the  development  of  various  chronic  diseases  and  metabolic  disorders.  Physical  exercises  help  to  improve  metabolism 
and cardioprotection, reduce insulin resistance, and lead to a better oxidative ability and overall health. Physical exercises 
improve the metabolism in muscles and in the whole organism. This may be due to their participation in the regulation of 
catabolic  and  anabolic  processes  depending  on  energy  needs,  as  well  as  the  improvement  of  mitochondrial  function  by 
activating mitochondrial biogenesis and remodeling, increasing the density of mitochondria and their viability. The types 
of physical activity are considered, the level of physical activity is assessed. It is concluded, that regular physical activity, 
including aerobic and anaerobic exercises, should be an integral component of the prevention and treatment of metabolic 
disorders, including metabolic syndrome.
Key words: physical activity, metabolism, mitochondria, metabolic syndrome, ATP
