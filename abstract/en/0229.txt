Atherosclerosis is the most common among the population and the most controversial pathology. The issues concerning the 
etiology and pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of its manifestations need further discussion. Based on the analysis of 
literature data, own observations and studies, the article proves the stressful character of atherogenic disorders in children 
with hypotrophy and obesity. At the same time, the development of atherogenesis emphasizes the starting role of oxidative 
stress, triggering energy disorders in cells, destabilization of cell membranes, damage to the vascular endothelium, initiation 
of inflammatory and autoimmune processes, as well as metabolic, endocrine and other disorders. It is noted that the course of 
the pathological process is undulating, progressive, characterized by a change in stages and phases. These changes indicate the 
need for early correction of the atherogenic shifts. The use of L-carnitine preparations is justified.
Key words: children, hypotrophy, obesity, pathogenesis, atherosclerosis, chronic stress, oxidative stress, L-carnitine.
