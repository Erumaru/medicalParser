The article reflects the issues of epidemiology, etiopathogenesis and treatment of acute respiratory viral diseases (ARVI) of ENT organs. The authors consider
in detail the effects of the use of sea water solutions, which include the increase of ciliary motility, the activation of reparative processes in the cells of the
nasal mucosa and the normalization of their functions, and as a local therapy for rhinitis in ARVI, taking into account the experience of domestic and foreign
specialists. Features of various forms of sea water solutions are described, among which the individual dropper-tubes are the most preferable, sparing and
hygienic ones. This form is available for the sea water solution Sialor® aqua.
The article highlights the problem of rhinosinusitis as the most frequent complication of acute respiratory viral infections, which leads to the obstruction of
natural openings of the paranasal sinuses, mostly treated by vasoconstrictive drugs. Various vasoconstrictors and peculiarities of their use in the practice of
an otorhinolaryngologist are considered. The article describes the advantages of using oxymetazoline, which acquires a  therapeutic activity at lower con-
centrations than other vasoconstrictors, providing creation of oxymetazoline dosage forms at concentrations of 0.05%, 0.025%, and a concentration of 0.01%
(Sialor® rhino), which is effective and safe even in infants and newborns.
Key words: otorhinolaryngological specialized care, acute rhinosinusitis, local treatment.
