Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are heterogeneous group of disorders. Among them, dermatomyositis and polymyositis traditionally belonging to con-
nective tissue disorders are of special importance. Myopathy of various severity is typical of other conditions (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus ery-
thematosus, scleroderma, Sjogren’s syndrome etc.) thus making differential diagnosis more difficult. Considering this, overlap syndromes in rheumatology
become relevant. This clinical case highlights a number of features which are beyond classical signs of idiopathic polymyositis, i.e., acute disease onset with
fever in a man, disease manifested as symmetric arthritis of wrist and radiocarpal joints, long-term disease course masked with non-infectious arthritis, pul-
monary manifestations and myopathy occurred simultaneously, dysphagia and dysphonia, and stable therapeutic effect from low doses of corticosteroids.
These aspects require careful follow-up and differential diagnosis with other connective tissue disorders.
Key words: dermatomyositis, polymyositis, overlap syndromes, idiopathic myopathies.
