Asthenia (from greek "asthéneia" - impotence, weakness) is an unhealthy condition, manifesting with fatigue and exhaustion with excessive mood volatility,
weakening of self-control, impatience, restlessness, sleep disorders, loss of ability to long-term mental and physical stress, intolerance of loud noises, bright
lights and pungent smells. The frequency of this disease in general practice ranges from 15% to 57%. According to Russian trials it is the most common symp-
tom in outpatient practice and its frequency can reach 90%.
There is no conventional classification of asthenia. The most convenient and useful classification for practitioner is based on the nature of asthenic syndrome:
reactive, primary and secondary. Currently there are more than 40 different medicines for pharmacological management of asthenia (psychotropic drugs,
especially antidepressants and psychostimulants, tonic and vitamin supplements, drugs improving cerebral metabolism). Kogitum is one of specific antias-
thenic drugs (active substance is acetilaminsuccininc acid, that is active compound of central nerve system with stimulating effect, contributing to normal-
ization of nervous processes regulation).
Keywords: asthenia, acetilaminsuccininc acid, Kogitum.
