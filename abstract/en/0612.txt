The paper reviews recent relevant data on the causes and mechanisms of the development of respiratory allergy as well as on major allergens. Classification
and clinical signs of allergic rhinitis (AR), classic respiratory allergy which affects upper airways, are presented. The paper describes in details the most im-
portant specific abiotic factors of living quarters which predispose to allergy and allergic disorders of the airways, i.e., room temperature, humidity, air pol-
lution and ionic composition, static electricity, passive smoking. Recommendations on the improvement of living quarter ecology in the context of preventive
medicine are provided. The causes and clinical signs of insect and fungal allergies are summarized. The term "sick building syndrome" is explained. Basic prin-
ciples of medical treatment of respiratory allergy are discussed, i.e., the avoidance of causative allergen(s), the compliance with sanitary hygienic standards
of keeping living quarters, hypoallergenic diet, and pharmacotherapy. The importance  of antihistamines in the treatment of allergic diseases is emphasized.
The use of Suprastinex/levocetirizine in the complex treatment of respiratory allergy is evaluated.
Key words: allergy, respiratory allergens, ecology of living quarter, antihistamines.
