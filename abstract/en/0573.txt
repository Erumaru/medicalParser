In Russia, budesonide multimatrix (MMX®, Cortiment®) is approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Budesonide is a topical corticosteroid with anti-in-
flammatory effects which are superior to that of many other glucocorticoids. Cortiment is formulated to release budesonide at a controlled rate throughout
the colon. The paper summarizes the results of CORE I and CORE II trials which assessed the efficacy and safety of budesonide MMX in adults with mild to
moderate ulcerative colitis. Budesonide MMX 9 mg was statistically significantly more effective than placebo in several patient groups. Budesonide had a
better safety profile as compared with the first-generation oral corticosteroids (i.e., prednisone and prednisolone). Cortiment is highly effective in the lack of
response to the treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid.
Key words: budesonide, Cortiment, clinical remission, mucosal healing, ulcerative colitis.
