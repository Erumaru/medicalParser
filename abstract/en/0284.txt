Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is the process of thrombus formation in portal system, due to many acute or chronic factors. In acute thrombosis hepatocellu-
lar failure, progressive portal hypertension, bowel necrosis, gastrointestinal bleeding develop due to mass death of hepatocytes, which lead to extremely un-
favourable outcome, and frequently death. PVT prevalence in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension (PH) ranges from 2 to 43%, with hepato-
cellular carcinoma - up to 30%. In 50% of cases the cause remains unknown. Clinical manifestations depend on the location and extent of PVT, speed of its
development and the nature of predisposing liver disease. Combination of PVT and mesenteric vein thrombosis in most cases is lethal. In chronic process,
thrombosis is formed slowly, so collateral blood flow develops and portal vein recanalizes over time. Even in case of relatively favorable course PH develops.
Diagnosis is based on ultrasound data, MSCT, coagulogram, if necessary - angiography. The paper highlights some aspects of PVT clinical picture, princi-
ples of its diagnosis and treatment. It is emphasized that PVT is a serious condition requiring immediate diagnosis and intensive treatment to prevent life-
threatening complications and PH progression. A clinical case of PVT in patients with acute pancreatitis and chronic alimentary toxic hepatitis is reported.
Key words: portal vein thrombosis, portal hypertension, acute pancreatitis, chronic toxic hepatitis, anticoagulant therapy.
