Osteoarthrosis  (OA) is the most common joint disease in humans. In recent years, the use of  hyaluronic acid (HA) preparations for intra-articular adminis-
tration has been increased.
Aim. To study the effect of viscosupplementary therapy with AC "Fermatron" on the need for the knee replacement in patients with osteoarthrosis.
Patients and Methods. A retrospective analysis of medical records of patients with a verified diagnosis of OA for the period from 2013 to 2015 was conducted.
For the analysis 2 groups of patients were formed (the main group -388 people (295 women and 93 men) and the control group-378 people (276 women and
102 men)). The average age of the patients was 63.5 ± 9.5 years. To objectify the data obtained, three age subgroups of 50-60 years old, 61-70 years old and
over 71 years old, were identified. Patients of the control group received traditional OA therapy. Patients of the main group additionally received the intra-
articular injections of the drug "Fermatron" 1% 2 ml by courses of 3 injections into the target joint with an interval of 7 days. The number of courses varied
from one to three with 8-12 months intervals. Assessment of the need for the knee replacement was carried out at the end of 2015.
Results. After three years in the main group, the total number of patients requiring the joint replacement was 11.1%, which was almost two times lower than
in the control group - 21.3% (p <0.05). The need for the joint replacement in the patients of the main group who received the "Fermatron" by three times cours-
es is significantly lower in all age groups than in the control group, and it amounts to correspondingly 10.10% and 21, 65% at the age of 51-60 years; 12.24%
and 33.3% at the age of 61-70 years; 29.17% and 50% (p <0.05) at the age of 71 years. For patients older than 71 years with IV radiographic stage in the
main and control groups, the differences are not reliable.
Conclusions. Intra-articular administration of the drug "Fermatron" 1% 2 ml can be used to treat patients of all age groups with OA of knee joints, not only
to modify the symptoms of the disease, but also to delay the joint replacement. In this case, the best effect of the therapy is observed when the courses are re-
peated at intervals of 8 to 12 months.
