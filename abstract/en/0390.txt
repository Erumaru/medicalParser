The population of the Earth is aging, and this process is largely due to advances in pharmacology. The appointment of modern medicines to elderly people
contributes to the prolongation of their life, prevents the development of certain diseases and complications, but the use of excessive amounts of drugs by el-
derly people can lead to adverse drug events, including serious and fatal ones. At the same time, as the patients become older and frailer, the emphasis of
pharmacotherapy shifts towards controlling the symptoms of diseases, improving the quality of life and minimizing the use of potentially dangerous pre-
ventive drugs that will benefit little over a relatively short expected life expectancy. To reduce the risk of negative consequences of polypharmacy in elderly
patients, a number of approaches can be recommended that include educational activities, ancillary computer systems, and modern methods presented by
the authors in this article: anticholinergic load scales, STOPP / START criteria, Bierce criteria, index of rational drugs administration, comorbidity indices.
The use of these tools during the drug audit can reduce the drug load and improve the safety of pharmacotherapy.
Key words: elderly, safety, polypharmacy.
