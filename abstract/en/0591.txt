Primary teeth eruption is the greatest challenge for children and their parents, as well as for a pediatrician. It’s a false belief, 
that the milk teeth are only temporary organs, which will be replaced by permanent teeth, and that their diseases and loss 
do not have any consequences. This article presents an analysis of the literature devoted to the problem of teething. It is 
emphasized, that teething syndrome should be the diagnosis of exclusion. The clinical symptoms, detected during the primary 
teeth eruption, are not specific. The article presents current data, revealing the pathogenetic mechanisms of development of 
local and systemic manifestations in this case. The leading role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the clinical manifestation 
of such symptoms of teething as hyperemia, tenderness and swelling of the gums, increased body temperature and sleep 
disturbance, is shown. The issues of the safe and effective use of topical medications to reduce discomfort during teething are 
discussed. The characteristics of Kamistad® Baby, which is successfully used for relief of local manifestations of the teething 
syndrome, are presented.
Key words: children, teeth, teething, Kamistad® Baby, medicines used to reduce local symptoms of primary teeth eruption, pro-
inflammatory cytokines.
