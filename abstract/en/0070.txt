Long-delayed anti-inflammatory drugs (LDAIDs) — the basis of pharmacotherapy of osteoarthritis (OA). However, the effect of 
LDAIDs does not occur immediately, therefore, when treating patients with OA who are experiencing severe pain, it is advisable 
to combine them with fast-acting analgesics, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Aim: to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation combination of non-saponifying compounds of avocado and soy (NSCAS) 
and ketoprofen lysine salt (KLS) in patients with OA of the knee.
Patients  and  Methods:  a  study  group  consisted  of  6448  patients  with  OA,  70.9%  of  women  and  29.1%  of  men,  average 
age –57.8±10.2 years, with severe pain (≥40 mm by the visual analog scale (VAS)). Of these, 1638 (25.4%) were under 50 
years  old  and  had  a  radiological  stage  ≤  1  according  to  Kellgren-Lawrence  (conditionally,  “early”  OA  (EOA)).  All  patients 
were prescribed NSCAS (Piascledine) 300 mg/day. During the first 2 weeks, patients received KLS (Artrosilene capsules) 320 
mg/day. They could also use KLS topically (Artrosilene spray). At a later stage, with increased pain, patients could take KLS 
with or without a topical form of KLS with short courses or “on demand”. The main criterion of effectiveness was the dynamics 
of pain during movement (according to VAS) after 2 weeks and 3 months of therapy.
Results: an average duration of oral administration of KLS at the beginning of treatment was 12.4±3.4 days. In the future, 44% 
of patients received KLS in short courses (3–5 days), and 24.3% in the “on demand” mode (1–2 times per week during pain). 
70.1% also used KLS spray in short courses or “on demand”. In 4.3% of patients, intra-articular administration of glucocorticoids 
was required.
The severity of pain initially amounted to 63.7±12.0 mm, after 2 weeks — 32.6±16.2 mm, after 3 months — 14.2±11.7 mm. The 
vast majority of patients (81.7%) rated the outcome of the treatment as “good” or “excellent”. The pain dynamics did not differ 
in the EOA group and in patients ≥50 years of age with a radiological stage ≥2 according to Kellgren-Lawrence: pain reduction 
after 2 weeks amounted to 30.4±15.1 and 31.4±14.9, after 3 months — 50.5±18.7 and 49.1±19.1 mm according to VAS (the 
difference is not significant).
The main adverse events were dyspepsia (3.5%), arterial hypertension (2.3%) and skin allergic reactions (0.2%). No information 
on serious adverse events has been received.
Conclusion: the combined administration of NSCAS and KLS allows for fast and long-term pain control in OA, regardless of the 
stage of the disease.
