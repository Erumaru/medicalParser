Migraine is characterized by high maladaptation and a decrease in the quality of life of patients due to the high frequency, duration and severity of headache
attacks. Comorbid diseases and frequent cephalgia attacks significantly contribute to the unfavorable course, further chronicization of migraine and a worse
prognosis in these patients. The comorbid diseases make the pain itself heavier and worsen the condition of patients in the attack-free period. In this regard,
the main areas of migraine therapy are the relief of an already developed attack, preventive therapy aimed at preventing repeated attacks and treating co-
morbid disorders. Triptans (selective 5-HT1B / D receptor serotonin agonists) represent a group of the most effective, pathogenetically valid drugs for reliev-
ing migraine attacks. Analysis of the clinical use of Migrepam® (zolmitriptan) for relieving migraine attacks without an aura demonstrates its high efficacy,
good tolerability and safety. Effective and timely relief of attacks, adequate preventive treatment and treatment of comorbid diseases, can significantly fa-
cilitate the course of migraine, improve social adaptation, quality of life and prevent the chronicization of migraine in most patients.
