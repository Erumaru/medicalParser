The article presents detailed data on wound infection, classification of wounds, their clinical manifestations and management tactics. The main attention is
paid to the local therapy, in particular, preparations of silver. Taking into accounts the wide prevalence of wound infections among the population and a
sharp decrease in sensitivity to traditional antibacterial drugs (for example, tetracycline, erythromycin and lincomycin ointment, medicines containing gen-
tamicin), the external use of silver medications in infected skin diseases is the most relevant. The author explores in detail the mechanisms of silver ions
action on a bacterial cell, describes the anti-inflammatory and regenerative effect of silver preparations for pustular skin diseases; clinical observations of
external therapy with a silver-containing drug Argosulphan are given and its effectiveness in the therapy of this category of patients is noted. Sulfatiazole
silver (Argosulfan) is an antimicrobial topical chemical used to heal wounds of various origins. In the Department of Purulent Surgery of " Krasnoyarsk Clin-
ical Hospital No. 7", sulfatiazole silver is used in patients with chronic long-term non-healing wounds of various locations, contributing to earlier epithelial-
ization and scarring.
Key words: wound, wound process, wound infection, silver, sulfatiazole silver.
