The article considers the main aspects of the use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for the primary and secondary stroke prevention. It is shown that in primary
prevention, it is necessary to single out the category of people with an increased risk of stroke, for which the use of ASA may be most effective. This catego-
ry includes women over 75 years old with moderate and high ten-year CAD risk, patients with arterial hypertension and chronic kidney disease of the 3rd
stage, persons with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis, as well as patients with coronary pathology. In secondary prevention, ASA is mostly used in non-
cardioembolic stroke, as well as in cardioembolic stroke, which developed against a background of cardiac pathology that does not require oral anticoagu-
lant therapy. The optimal daily dosage of ASA for a long use is 75-150 mg per day. To improve compliance to treatment, the most optimal drug form is the
enteric-soluble form of ASA.
Key words: Ischemic stroke, primary prevention, secondary prevention, acetylsalicylic acid, enteric-soluble form.
