Summary
Aim. To assess dynamic changes in plasma and red blood cell magnesium (Mg) levels in the course of intensive physical exercise, to examine the relation-
ships between Mg and maximum aerobic power, hormonal balance, and cardiovascular health in athletes, and to study the efficacy of organic Mg salts in
athletes.
Patients and methods. 245 sportsmen (i.e., 18 runners, 24 marathoners, 8 swimmers, 14 handballers, 7 amateurs, 130 athletes, and 44 juniors) as well as
20 healthy untrained volunteers were examined. Serum, plasma, red blood cell, and urine levels of electrolytes, levels of various hormones (i.e., cortisol, tri-
iodothyronine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyrotrophic hormone, adrenalin, noradrenalin, parathyroid hormone, insulin, and glucagon), and biochemical
parameters were measured. Antioxidant status was analyzed. Ergometry testing which determines maximum aerobic power, bio-impedance analysis which
assesses muscle strength, and electroencephalography were performed.
Results. Intensive physical exercise results in the loss of magnesium which can be diagnosed by reduced Mg levels in the biological substrates. Magnesium
deficiency leads to the decrease in metabolic (including immunological) parameters under physical exercise, lack of endurance and recovery after physical
activity. Organic Mg salts are highly effective medications for athletes.
Conclusions. Magnesium orotate/Magnerot® improves muscle contraction and relaxation, endurance, and energy metabolism. These aspects are of special
importance for maintaining top physiological condition.
Key words: sports medicine, Magnerot®, micronutrients.
