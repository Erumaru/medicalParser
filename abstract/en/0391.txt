Planning of  the therapeutic interventions in the elderly patients is impossible without taking into account the influence of the therapy on physical and cog-
nitive functioning. Despite the convincing evidence of an unfavorable predictive value of high blood pressure (BP) in middle-aged people, its effect on prog-
nosis in the very elderly people is still discussed, as well as the question of whether to treat arterial hypertension (AH) in elderly patients, and how intensively.
The review presents data of observational and randomized clinical trials that allow us to say that it is not the chronological but the biological age (senile as-
thenia), that becomes an important criterion for choosing the treatment of  hypertension in the elderly patients. The article discusses in detail the mechanisms
involved in the regulation of blood pressure, as well as the influence of BP on the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients of senile age. Recommendations
for antihypertensive therapy in elderly and senile patients are given.
Key words: arterial hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, very elderly people, senile asthenia, biological age.
