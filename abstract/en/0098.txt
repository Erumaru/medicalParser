In modern endocrinology, devices for continuous monitoring of glycemia have become an important tool for managing diabetes. 
In addition to the fact that they become more accurate and convenient in use, new options appear for estimating the glycemic 
profile,  such  as  information  on  the  trend  of  the  glycemic  curve,  quantification  of  the  duration  and  amplitude  of  glucose 
fluctuations.  Obtained  information,  during  long-term  monitoring,  about  the  current  level  of  glucose  and  retrospective  data 
about the level of glucose can be used to build an outpatient glycemic profile. The outpatient glycemic profile of the patient is 
an individual and easy-to-use graph reflecting a complete picture of the compensation of diabetes due to the fact that, despite 
the level of glucose in the blood, such important indicators as glycemia variability and the duration of episodes of hypo- and 
hyperglycemia are also recorded. This technique helps to establish the causes of changes in the level of glycemia and resolve the 
issue of the correction advisability of therapy.
Continuous measurement of glucose concentration with determination of the duration of normal, hypo- and hyperglycemia  
(e. g., using the Abbott FreeStyle Libre) can significantly complement the level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as the integrated 
evaluation of glycemic control.
Key words: continuous glucose monitoring, ambulatory glycemic profile, diabetes mellitus, FreeStyle Libre.
