Acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. ARVI is a multisymptom disease, but the most common symp-
toms are still cough and rhinosinusitis. Every year billions of dollars are spent by patients around the world to purchase medicines to relief ARVI symptoms.
There are many over-the-counter (OTC) drugs for common cold and cough treatment. As ARVI is a multisymptom disease it requires several drugs to relief
symptoms: antiviral, antihistamines, antitussives, topical decongestants, antipyretics, bronchodilators, etc. The need to relief all ARVI symptoms leads to
polypharmacy. At the same time, many patients try to treat themselves with home remedies. However, the lack of timely correct ARVI treatment can lead to
severe complications - bronchitis, pneumonia, post-infectious cough.
The paper emphasizes the necessity of early prescription of combination drugs that can reduce the number and frequency of drug intake. The data of nu-
merous trials are provided, whereby the most effective fixed combinations of mucoactive drugs are combinations of salbutamol, bromhexine, guaifenesin and
levomenthol (of syrup Ascoril expectorant ®) and salbutamol, bromhexine and guaifenesin (of Askoril® tablets).
Key words: acute respiratory viral infection, common cold, respiratory tract infection, cough, post- infectious cough, viral infections, quality of life, fixed com-
bination, Askoril®, Ascoril expectorant ®.
