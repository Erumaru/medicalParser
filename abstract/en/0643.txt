The pharynx performs an important functional role in the human body. Infectious-inflammatory diseases of the pharynx are still the most frequent cause of
applications of patients to doctors of various specialties for ambulatory treatment. Normally, the pharynx has a diverse and dynamic microflora, thus the in-
terpretation of the results of microbiological research and, accordingly, the appointment of adequate treatment to the patients with pharyngeal pathology is
a difficult task. Tonsillopharyngitis accounts for about 30% of all diagnosed otorhinolaryngological nosologies and requires adequate pharmacotherapy.
Local antimicrobial drugs take the main place in the treatment of patients with inflammatory diseases of the pharynx. The widely used topical drug Grammi-
dine (gramicidin C and cetylpyridinium chloride/±oxybuprocaine) occupies one of the leading positions in the arsenal of doctors due to its effectiveness,
easy intaking and a good safety. Grammidine dosage spray is a new form of a well-proven drug which efficacy and safety is demonstrated by the results of
a multicenter clinical trial.
Key words: functions of the pharynx, tonsillopharyngitis, infectious and inflammatory diseases of the pharynx, pharyngeal microflora, local antimicrobial
therapy, Grammidine dosage spray.
