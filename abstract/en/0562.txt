The development of chemotherapy has led to significant progress in the therapy of malignant tumors, but its effectiveness against brain metastases remains
insufficient. Fractional whole brain radiotherapy, surgical treatment and radiosurgery are the standard methods of treating patients with brain metastases.
Improving the methods of neuroimaging, the introduction into clinical practice of the principles of microsurgery and radiosurgery with the use of the Gam-
ma-knife and Cyber-knife devices has significantly changed the results of treatment of patients with brain metastases, which allowed to formulate new prin-
ciples for the treatment of this group of patients.
This review summarizes the available methods for treating patients with brain metastases, with an emphasis on overall survival, local control, distant metas-
tases, quality of life, and the potential for potential combinations of existing treatments. The article shows that personalized approaches in the treatment of
patients with brain metastases are optimal and improve the results of treatment.
Key words: brain metastases, radiosurgery, microsurgery, whole brain radiotherapy.
