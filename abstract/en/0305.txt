Defects  of  the  epidermis  are  the  entrance  gate  for  potential  allergens  of  the  external  environment,  which  can  lead  to  the 
development of a type I hypersensitivity reaction, which underlies atopic dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, etc. Therefore, the 
basic method for the prevention and treatment of exacerbations of the disease and an increase in the duration of the remission 
period is the regular use of emollients, daily application of which to the skin of newborns reliably reduces the risk of atopic 
dermatitis in the future twice.
The  active  ingredient  of  the  drug  D­Panthenol  (EGIS  Pharmaceuticals  PLC)  —  dexpanthenol,  helps  to  compensate  for  the 
subclinical dysfunction of the skin barrier, and also prevents the development of an inflammatory reaction by replenishing skin 
hydration and reducing skin permeability to allergens. Lanolin and white beeswax, which are part of the drug, contribute to 
the restoration of the lipid composition of the skin, thereby enhancing the action of the main substance. The drug is available 
in two dosage forms: cream and ointment. D­Panthenol is the basic step in the treatment of atopic dermatitis according to the 
Federal Clinical Guidelines for the treatment of this disease, which indicates that the drug is used for any degree of severity of 
the pathology.
Key words: prevention of atopic dermatitis, epidermis defects, skin barrier, emollients, dexpanthenol, D­Panthenol.
