The paper summarizes the latest evidence-based data on epidemiology, pathogenesis, classification, clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and treat-
ment approaches to itching as well as own clinical observations. Itching is one of the most common symptoms in dermatology. Pain and itching significant-
ly reduce patients’ quality of life. In some patients, itching amplifies and becomes chronic (over 6 weeks). The rate of chronic itching in total population varies
between 8.4% and 13.9%. Itching is considered as a sign of skin disorders as well as systemic internal diseases (i.e., renal or liver failure, diabetes), neu-
ropathology, psychopathology, and paraneoplasia. This requires accurate pathology diagnosis and results in treatment challenges. Recommendations for the
management of itching include Antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, systemic corticosteroids, opioid agonists, gabapentin, antidepressants, serotonin an-
tagonists, and cyclosporine A. Topical antipruritic drugs include local anesthetics, topical corticosteroids, capsaicin, cannabinoid antagonists, tacrolimus and
pimecrolimus, zinc, menthol and camphor, mast cell stabilizers.
Key words: itching, neurogenic inflammation, antihistamines, allergic dermatoses.
