Regardless of the socioeconomic development of the country, the main causes of death and disability of elderly and senile 
people (60 years and older) are noncontagious diseases, many of which are often found together. According to the World Health 
Organization, more than 20% of adults aged 60 years and older suffer from psychoneurological disorders. In elderly people with 
ischemic heart disease (IHD), the incidence of depression is higher compared to those with good health. Treatment of patients with 
cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and mental pathology should be comprehensive and include both drug and non-pharmacological 
therapy. The article discusses the possibilities of therapy with the preparation Tenoten for patients suffering from CVD. There 
are data of clinical studies confirming that the drug positively influences the blood pressure profile (BP) in women with arterial 
hypertension (AH) in postmenopause, in early forms of AH it promotes more rapid achievement of the target values of blood 
pressure, and leads to statistically significant improvement of the clinical status in patients with acute myocardial infarction. 
The role of modifying the CVD patient’s sedentary lifestyle is discussed as one of the non-pharmacological methods.
Key words: cardiovascular diseases, anxiety, depression, comorbidity, approaches to therapy, sedentary lifestyle, Tenoten.
