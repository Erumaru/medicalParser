The paper summarizes data on Meniere's disease, its clinical course, diagnostic algorithms, and treatment for acute vestibular vertigo and in remission be-
tween the attacks. The treatment of Meniere's disease is empirical as there is no common view on the etiology and pathogenesis of this disorder. Currently,
antiemetic drugs and vestibular suppressants are prescribed for Meniere's disease attacks, however, they can be used for several days only since they inhib-
it compensatory mechanisms of acute peripheral vestibular disease. The major agents for acute vertigo are anticholinergic drugs, antihistamines, dopamine
antagonists, and benzodiazepines. Randomized clinical trials, non-interventional studies (which reproduce daily management algorithms), and meta-analy-
sis demonstrate the efficacy of Vertigoheel for vertigo. The efficacy of Vertigoheel is similar to that of dimenhydrinate. When conservative treatment (in-
cluding medical labyrinthectomy) is obviously ineffective, surgical procedures might be an option.
Key words: Meniere's disease, systemic vertigo, sensoneural hearing loss, ringing in the ear, vestibula r disorders, endolymphatic hydrops, Vertigoheel.
