Throughout the world, the rate of complications in extracardiac surgeries ranges from 7 to 11%, the lethality ranges from 0.8 to 
1.5%. Cardiovascular complications in the perioperative period are the main interdisciplinary problem. The comorbid background 
is much more common among elderly and senile patients than in middle-aged patients, that increases the number of surgical 
interventions performed in elderly patients with a burdened cardiac anamnesis, which cannot and should not be a reason for 
a refusal from surgical treatment. Therefore, the problem of stratification and modification of perioperative risk factors, the 
systematization of schemes and methods for perioperative and intraoperative cardiac monitoring is very important and urgent, 
which  makes  it  possible  to  predict  the  probability  of  postoperative  complications  and  optimize  the  therapeutic  regimens  of 
postoperative cardiac support in the hospital and outpatient stage. The main aim of a competent perioperative monitoring is 
to improve patient outcomes and reduce economic costs. The article considers the current provisions on the stratification of 
cardiac perioperative risk in extracardiac interventions, and identifies the problems requiring further study.
Key words: cardiac risk, extracardiac surgical intervention, perioperative complications.
