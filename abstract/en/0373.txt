Vertigo refers to the most common symptoms observed in clinical practice and is one of the 10 most common causes of neurological examination. Vertigo can
occur at any age, but it is more common in elderly patients. Most patients with vertigo seek help from neurologists. Despite the availability of modern
methods of examination, differential diagnosis of vertigo is often not carried out. Patients do not receive adequate therapy. The article discusses terminology,
classification of vertigo, clinical methods of diagnosing central and peripheral vestibulopathy, differential diagnosis of various parameters (duration of
dizziness, sensation, etc.) necessary to determine vertigo subtypes. General questions of management of patients are considered. Treatment of patients with
chronic vertigo is a difficult task. A multi-purpose drug for the treatment of vertigo of various origins is Vertigohel ®. The article shows the clinical efficacy of
Vertigohel ®, which has been evaluated in numerous scientific studies, including randomized clinical trials, non-interventional studies reflecting the use in
daily treatment of patients, and meta-analysis of clinical trials. Vertigohel ® is an excellent choice for vertigo treatment and can be taken prior to examination
by a specialist. 
Key words: vertigo / dizziness, non-vestibular vertigo, vestibular vertigo, multicomponent, multipurpose, Vertigohel ®.
