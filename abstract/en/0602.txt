Urticaria is a common skin disorder characterized by skin rash which primary element is blister. According to epidemiological studies, 15% to 25% of the pop-
ulation will experience an episode of urticaria at least once in their lives. In 25% of patients, urticaria becomes chronic. The paper discusses known and prob-
able causative factors for urticaria in order to optimize diagnostic and treatment modalities. Etiology, pathogenesis, clinical signs, and therapeutic ap-
proaches are described. Histamine is one of the key mediators of allergic inflammation. Hence, second-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonists are first-
line treatment for chronic urticaria. Desloratadine differs from other second-generation antihistamines in its triple mechanism of action, i.e., it blocks H1 re-
ceptors and provides significant anti-allergy and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the production of many mediators by mast cells, basophils, and oth-
er inflammatory cells. Desloratadine/Elizey can be recommended for chronic urticaria treatment due to its favorable safety profile and good tolerability.
Elizey significantly improves the quality of life in patients with chronic urticaria. No drug intolerance or side effects were documented.
Key words: urticaria, diagnosis, treatment, Elizey/desloratadine, efficacy, safety.
