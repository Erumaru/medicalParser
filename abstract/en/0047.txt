Thrombosis of cerebral veins and venous sinuses is a rare disease, which accounts for less than 1% of all cases of stroke. The most frequent and often early
symptom of thrombosis of cerebral veins and sinuses is a headache. Diagnosis of the disease is greatly hampered by the lack of specific characteristics of this
pain  and  the  possible  absence  of  other  neurological  manifestations.  In  this  regard,  headache  is  often  the  only  complaint  of  patients  with  thrombosis  of
cerebral venous sinuses. Due to the variability of clinical symptoms, often subacute or slow development, the disease is diagnosed late or remains unrecog-
nized. The thrombosis of the upper sagittal, lateral and transverse sinuses is the most common problem. Thrombosis of several cerebral veins is observed in
2/3 of cases. This work presents anatomical features of the structure of the venous system of the brain, the issues of etiology, pathogenesis, clinical picture,
diagnosis and treatment of thrombosis of cerebral veins and venous sinuses.
The article presents three histories of the patients who received treatment in the second neurological department of the Scientific Center of Neurology at dif-
ferent time with a diagnosis of «thrombosis of the venous sinuses», demonstrating the modern possibilities of diagnosis and treatment of venous circulation
disorders.
Key words: thrombosis of venous sinuses, cerebral vein thrombosis, headache, diagnostics, anticoagulants.
