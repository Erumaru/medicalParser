Over the past few years, recommendations for treating patients with high-risk nonmetastatic prostate cancer have changed significantly. This publication
reviews the clinical and pathological criteria needed to determine the optimal treatment for this group of patients. To determine the optimal method of trea-
tment, mandatory examination is necessary in order to exclude the metastatic lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and osteoscintigraphy are among
the recommended methods of examination. The determining factor in the choice of treatment is life expectancy, and concomitant diseases. High radiation
doses are essential to achieve the therapeutic effect, while the addition of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) statistically significantly improves the overall
and cancer-specific survival. The long-term  appointment of neo / adjuvant ADT (2-3 years) significantly improves survival compared with short-term ADT
(4-6 months). Radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection is considered an acceptable method of treatment, and ADT alone is an inap-
propriate treatment option for treating this group of patients.
Key words: prostate cancer, high-risk cancer groups, androgen deprivation therapy, hormonal therapy, remote radiation therapy, radical prostatectomy.
