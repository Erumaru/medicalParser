Current issues of the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis
An interview with Prof. Camil Castello Branco (University of Barcelona, Spain), the Chairman of the Council of Affiliated Menopause Societies of the
International Menopause Society, and Prof. Svetlana S. Rodionova, the Head of the Center of Osteoporosis (N.N. Priorov Central Institute of Trauma-
tology and Orthopedics, Moscow, Russia).

Interdisciplinary discussion of osteoporosis with the participation of gynecologist endocrinologist and traumatologist provided clinicians with relevant in-
formation on the prevention and treatment of this disorder. The role of calcium in osteoporosis treatment was highlighted. Recommended daily amount of cal-
cium is 1-1.2 g. Intake of this amount of calcium in osteoporosis is required since the therapy is ineffective in calcium deficiency. Calcium supplement choice
in different clinical conditions and specificity of fixed-dose combination (of calcium and vitamin D) prescription are discussed. Special attention is given to
ossein-hydroxyapatite complex (OHC) and its advantages in terms of efficacy and safety, ease of use and dose selection (according to European study re-
sults). Thus, OHC does not provoke flatulence or dyspepsia. OHC dose can be adjusted for calcium intake with food. Early markers of osteoporosis in post-
menopausal women, individual treatment regimens, and specificity of osteotropic pharmacotherapy in high risk of delayed consolidation are described.
