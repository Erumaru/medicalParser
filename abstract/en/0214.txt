One of the most frequent reasons for medical help seeking is a chronic heart failure (CHF) and a dyspnea as its main manifestation. The introduction gives
historical information and quotes from the great Russian therapists about this syndrome. The article presents the stages of the dyspnea outpatient diagnos-
tic process: survey algorithms, consideration of anamnestic data, analysis of physical data and basic laboratory indicators, differential diagnostics of major
diseases accompanied by dyspnea. The article considers the key issues of the CHF pathogenesis, new ideas about the pathomorphism of chronic heart fail-
ure, the causes and mechanisms of CHF decompensation, the methods for assessing the clinical state of patients with heart failure. The directions of drug ther-
apy, including diuretics, are discussed. One of the modern drugs of this class is torasemid — a clinically and pharmacoeconomicaly effective diuretic with a
high and predictable bioavailability, long half-life, which showed good clinical results in several studies with a high degree of evidence. Due to the mentioned
properties torasemid can be recommended for a wide application in outpatient practice in the management of patients with chronic heart failure.
Key words: dyspnea, heart failure, respiratory failure, diuretics, torasemid.
