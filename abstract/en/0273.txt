Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease of unknown etiology, characterized by chronic erosive arthritis, damage to the 
internal organs, to which a wavy course with alternating high and low activity periods is typical. The socioeconomic consequences in the RA incidence 
are due to the fact that people of working age are affected, hence, the patients’ life quality decreases significantly. The foreign and domestic data 
confirm the RA high prevalence both in Russia and abroad. RA problem significance resides in that disease remains a fairly frequent cause of patients 
disability. RA etiology remains largely unclear. This disease belongs to a large multifactor disease group, in which the clinical phenotype is extremely 
polymorphic and arises from the interaction between the polygenic component and environmental factors. Unlike classical genetic diseases, in which 
many different genes and their combinations predispose to the disease development, RA is a genetically heterogeneous disease. Therefore, an in­
depth study of etiology factors is necessary in order to identify risk groups and be able to prevent its occurrence and progression. The article provides 
a literature data overview on one of the least studied susceptibility genes to RA, such as CCR5, as well as this gene association with other diseases.
Keywords: rheumatoid arthritis, susceptibility genes, gene polymorphism, ССR5 gene.
