Hypokalemia  is  the  most  common  form  of  electrolyte  imbalance.  The  article  contains  the  etiological  and  pathogenetic  hypokalemia 
classification, which includes more than 20 categories and reflects a wide range of conditions, accompanied by a decrease in the level of 
potassium in the blood to 3.5 mmol/l and below. A significant part of the hypokalemia etiopathogenetic variants is considered in detail in 
terms of causes and mechanisms of its development. Particular attention is paid to iatrogenic hypokalemia, which is an intensive therapy 
complication, as well as hypokalemia in the setting of relatively rare conditions and diseases, little known to practitioners. The main part of 
the article is devoted to the definitions of hypokalemia syndrome and its clinical and laboratory diagnosis. The article also shows exceptional 
variability and nonspecific nature of syndrome clinical manifestations, simulating a variety, usually acute pathology, which in fact makes 
it almost impossible to diagnose hypokalemia clinically. At the same time, hypokalemia syndrome verification by the level of potassium in 
the blood is also associated with a number of objective and subjective limitations and difficulties. Methods, means, and ways to overcome 
diagnostic  difficulties  are  specified.  A  scheme-algorithm  for  the  main  hypokalemia  types  diagnosis  is  proposed.  The  risks  accompanying 
dietary and medical correction of hypokalemia are analyzed. Safe approaches to hypokalemia elimination are discussed.
