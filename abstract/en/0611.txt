Summary
The paper discusses epidemiology, economic aspects, etiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of allergic rhinitis (AR). Current classification of AR, major clinical signs,
and treatment approaches are described. The importance of intranasal steroids as basic medications and antihistamines as symptomatic medications is highlight-
ed. Mometasone furoate is superior to other topical steroids since it is characterized by the broadest spectrum of approved indications for use, high efficacy, very
low bioavailability, and long-term experience of clinical use. A novel combination of mometasone furoate, intranasal steroid, and azelastine, topical antihistamine,
for mild and moderate intermittent AR is presented. This nasal spray is the first and the only medication in Russia which combines the most effective members of
their classes with different mechanism of action. As a result, the drug affects AR pathogenesis and effectively reduces its troublesome symptoms.
Key words: allergic rhinitis, seasonal, mometasone furoate, azelastine, Momate Rhino Advance.
