Diabetes mellitus (DM) has the character of epidemy in the world and affects at least 8,3% of population. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) is a type of
diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy. DAN prevalence gradually increases with patients age, DM duration and poor glycemic control. DAN can affect all or-
gans and systems, or just some of them (eg, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, urogenital system), can present with clinical manifestation (pos-
itive and negative neuropathic symptoms) or without any symptoms. The paper addresses one DAN type - cardiac autonomic polyneuropathy, a serious DM
complication, dramatically reducing the quality of life and worsening the prognosis. DAN management includes decrease of insulin resistance, hyperglycemia
correction, symptomatic treatment of concomitant diseases and syndromes (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias).
Due to neurotropic effects B vitamins are traditionally used for DAN treatment. The paper discusses the clinical relevance of a complex preparation Neyro-
bion, and effects of B vitamins (thiamine, pyridoxine, cyanocobalamin) on nervous system.
Keywords: diabetic neuropathy, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, thiamine, pyridoxine, cyanocobalamin.
