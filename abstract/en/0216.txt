Sarcopenic obesity is characterized by significant decrease in muscle mass, strength, and functionality due to the fat accumulation and substitution of mus-
cle fibers by fat. This condition affects both elderly men and women and progresses with age. Sarcopenia worsens natural ageing and results in various com-
plications and chronic disorder progression thus increasing the risk of death. Several epidemiological studies demonstrate that the occurence of sarcopenic
obesity ranges from 4% to 84% in men and from 4% to 94% in women. Currently, no firm diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia exist. The European Working Group
on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) developed a diagnostic algorithm which includes the assessment of muscle strength, mass, and functionality.
Several studies revealed risk factors for the development and progression of sarcopenic obesity as well as analyzed potential pathogenic mechanisms to cause
this disease. A complex of preventive and therapeutic measures for sarcopenic obesity which includes diet and exercises was developed based on these find-
ings. In addition, novel therapeutic agents which prevent muscle tissue ageing and muscle strength and functionality decrease are developed.
Key words: sarcopenic obesity, sarcopenia, ageing, muscle mass decrease, diagnosis of sarcopenia.
