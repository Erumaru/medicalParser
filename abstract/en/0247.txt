Back pain (or dorsalgia) is one of the most common medical problems in the world today. 50-90% of adults suffer from lower back pain. Risk factors for low-
er back pain are the lack of physical activity, reduced physical fitness, functional deficiency, and muscular imbalance. Currently, complex management ap-
proach is generally accepted in daily practice which includes both pharmacotherapy (analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/NSAIDs, and my-
orelaxants) and non-pharmacological treatment (medical exercises, physiotherapy, manual therapy, and acupuncture) which potentiate each other. Lower
back pain treatment complex should include rational daily physical activity and various medical exercises. Current rehabilitation strategy in lower back pain
has three stages which correspond to disease stages (i.e., acute period, unstable remission, and stable remission). Every stage (i.e., relaxing, regenerative, or
training) has specific aims which are achieved by using proper techniques. Pathogenic and symptomatic pharmacotherapy (analgesic, irritating, or anti-in-
flammatory ointments, creams, and liniments) are of great importance for lower back pain treatment. Topical applications provide local therapeutic concen-
tration of a drug with minimal systemic side effects.
Key words: dorsalgia, pain, spine, hypokinesia, medical exercises, physiotherapy.
