The article discusses the actual problem of the timely detection and adequate therapy of a moderate cognitive disorder (MCD) 
and  a  sleep  disorder,  which  onset  impinge  on  patients  of  young  and  middle  age  with  hypertension  and  other  circulatory 
system diseases. Criteria for clinical diagnosis, neuropsychological approaches, neuroimaging methods and biomarkers are 
listed to determine the type of MCD and etiology of the disease. Special attention is paid to cognitive disorder associated with 
cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) — vascular cognitive disorder. There are data on the relationship between the sleep disorders, 
depression and MCD. It was emphasized that the correction of sleep disorders and depression in some cases allows achieving 
the recovery of cognitive functions. It was stated that the treatment of MCD, which onset is in young- and middle-aged patients, 
largely depends on the etiology of the disease. The data on the use of the drug Divaza in patients younger than 65 years old with 
CVD are presented. The use of the drug Divaza, which has an antihypoxant, antioxidant, nootropic and angioprotective effect, 
in combination with basic therapy allows to restore the quality of night sleep and reduce the severity of MCD.
Key words: cognitive functions, dementia, cognitive disorder, cerebrovascular disease, chronic cerebral ischemia, discirculatory 
encephalopathy, neuroimaging, biomarkers, protein S-100, Divasa.
