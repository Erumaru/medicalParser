The article highlights the main stages of cochlear implantation (CI) development and defines the main aspects of the cochlear implants creation. Since 1977
the company "MED-EL" began the world history of multi-channel CI. In the course of many years of work, the main aspects of the creation and development
of cochlear implants have been formed: the creation of an implant that does not impose restrictions on the signal used for stimulation, so that the intelligence
of the system lies in a component that is outside the body and can be easily improved; careful attitude towards the sensitive structures inside the cochlea; use
of the entire length of the cochlea, including the apical region, for stimulation, which should lead to the widest range of auditory sensations in height,
including a very low tone, and helps to avoid a long adaptation process caused by remapping of the perceived pitch range; ergonomics in the daily use of the
device by the recipients is essential for the acceptance and distribution of the implants. Among other things, constant struggle for power reduction has led
MED-EL to the path from the body-worn to behind-the-ear and portable wireless audio processors, and ultimately, fully implantable systems will be devel-
oped.
Key words: cochlear implantation, multichannel cochlear implant, deafness, aspects of cochlear implant creation.
