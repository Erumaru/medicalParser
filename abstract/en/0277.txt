Currently, there is no doubt that gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most common disease of the digestive system. Expressed polymorphism of
GERD clinical manifestations, typical chronic course significantly influence patient quality of life and are associated with direct and indirect economic costs.
Effective drug therapy includes proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), antacids, alginates, prokinetic agents, in case of H.pylori detection - eradication therapy. PPIs
use is highly effective in most cases in relieving main symptoms of the disease, healing of esophageal erosive lesions and preventing complications. Howev-
er, despite the success achieved with PPIs usage in GERD treatment, some significant problems are still unsolved. It determines the necessity of creation and
introduction into clinical practice of more advanced antisecretory drugs with prolonged antisecretory activity, flexible regimen, good safety and tolerability
profile. Dexilant® (dexlansoprazole - dextrorotatory enantiomer of lansoprazole) - a drug with implemented innovative technology of dual release of the ac-
tive ingredient to optimize the impact on intragastric pH, improve the clinical response to treatment and improve patient treatment adherence.
