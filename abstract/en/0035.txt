Protecting the sensitive skin of newborns, as well as maintaining the integrity and health of the skin barrier is a difficult but 
important task for professionals in the neonatal period which can have an impact on skin health in the future. Understanding 
the unique differences of the skin of newborn babies is essential for a daily care, including bathing, caring for the umbilical 
cord, and applying emollients to dry skin. In recent years, some practical approaches to the care of newborns have been revised, 
including excessive «hygienic activity», but the basic components of caring for a healthy and damaged skin of the baby remain 
unchanged and are based on an understanding of the anatomical and physiological features of the skin of a newborn baby 
as one of the most important functional systems. Tactics of a newborn’s skin care should be aimed primarily at preventing 
potentially harmful influences from environmental factors and requires a paradigm shift: from examining which product or 
regimen can be useful, to how possible intervention can lead to unexpected negative consequences, based on from the universal 
postulate «do no harm».
Key words: skin, newborn baby, skin care, bathing, diaper dermatitis, D-panthenol.
