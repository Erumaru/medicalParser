Currently chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) takes the 3d place among causes of death in developed countries, behind coronary artery disease
(CAD) and arterial hypertension (AH). Comorbidity of COPD and CAD is registered in 7-38% of patients. AH is observed in 34% of patients with COPD. The pa-
per addresses basic pathogenetic mechanisms of COPD development, its diagnosis and prognosis. Special attention is paid to pathogenesis of cardiovascular
diseases' (CVD) development in patients with COPD. CVD treatment is discussed with emphasis on drugs positively influencing COPD course. These medica-
tions include selective beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium channel antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, nitrates,
nitrate-like substances and metabolic drugs. It is established that patients with COPD develop systemic inflammation with cytokines and free radicals release.
Metabolic therapy is directed to prevention of free radical oxidation. Thiotriazoline is an example of pathogenetic metabolic therapy, an antihypoxant, influ-
encing energetic processes in myocardium, maintaining its metabolism under hypoxic conditions. It is indicated for patients with COPD and CVD.
Key words: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, Thiotriazoline.
