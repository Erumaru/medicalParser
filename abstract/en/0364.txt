Chronic pain is one of the major medical and socio-economic problems in the world. The effectiveness of therapy of patients with chronic pain syndrome is
insufficient, despite the increase in the number of analgesic drugs, physiotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic treatments. It is impossible to develop an optimal
treatment of chronic pain syndromes without knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms. The article considers the importance of diagnosing pain
syndrome in terms of specific causes of chronic back pain, as well as determining the pain source. Such identification, in turn, is based on clinical manifes-
tations and analysis of their relationship with various pathophysiological mechanisms. The therapeutic effect on pathophysiological mechanisms is carried
out by pathogenetically validated drugs and additional recommendation of food supplement Keltikan® complex. Keltikan® complex enhances the regeneration
of the nervous tissue, normalizes the processes of carrying out the nerve impulse, significantly reduces the severity of the pain syndrome in patients with pe-
ripheral neuropathies. The article considers the risk factors of lumbar pain syndrome, in the pathogenesis of which the myogenic, vascular, neurogenic and
other mechanisms are closely interconnected.
Key words: chronic back pain, nucleotides, Keltikan® complex.
