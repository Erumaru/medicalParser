General sensory innervation may cause headache and facial pain accompanying ophthalmic diseases or eye pain accompanying neurological pathology. In
most cases, if the primary cause of headache or facial pain is ophthalmic pathology, there is a clear clinical picture of eye damage with its redness and visual
blurring. But sometimes the eye disease is not so obvious. And it is very important for neurologist to suspect the ophthalmological nature of the pain syndrome
for the further adequate management of the patient. This publication presents an algorithm for differential diagnosis, simple examination methods and
emergency care for a patient with an angle-closure glaucoma attack.
Key words: angle-closure glaucoma, acute and subacute attack, intraocular pressure, trigger.
