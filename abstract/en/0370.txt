Migraine is one of the most frequent forms of primary headache. Migraine manifestes by episodic attacks of intense headache and accompanied by various
neurological, somatic, emotional-affective and vegetative manifestations. Diagnosis of migraine is based on a detailed clinical survey and examination of the
patient. Most migraine attacks occur suddenly, usually after exposure to triggers: endogenous and exogenous factors, among which there are emotional,
psychophysiological, hormonal and somatic, dietary factors, etc. Taking into account the clinical diversity of migraine forms and the individual effectiveness
of various treatments, the choice of the optimal means for a quick relief of the migraine attack should be found on a stratified approach based on the ranking
of migrainous attacks in severity and the degree of disruption in patient adaptation. Patients with severe and moderate attacks need to use specific drugs,
which include triptanes. Triptanes narrow the excessively dilated cranial vessels, inhibit the release of anti-inflammatory and vasoactive peptides, and inhibit
the transmission of pain at the level of the brainstem. An analysis of the characteristics of their clinical efficacy and safety is at the heart of the basic recom-
mendations for patients.
Key words: migraine, quick relief of the migraine attack, triptanes, zolmitriptan, sumatriptan.
