Disorders of blood flow in the arteries of the vertebrobasilar system account for about 70% of all transient ischemic attacks 
(TIA). Stroke with localization of focal changes in areas of the brain that receive blood along the arteries of this system develops 
2.5 times less often than in the carotid system. The diagnosis of insufficient blood flow in the arteries of the vertebrobasilar 
system is based on a characteristic symptom complex, which combines several groups of clinical symptoms that occur in patients 
with atherosclerosis (AS) and arterial hypertension (AH). These are visual and oculomotor disorders, violations of statics and 
coordination of movements, vestibular disorders. At various stages of vertebrobasilar insufficiency, patients often complain of 
memory loss, impaired cognitive functions, which significantly reduces the quality of life, and also affects the progression of 
cerebral vascular insufficiency. Treatment of vertebrobasilar insufficiency is aimed at preventing its progression, improvement 
of blood supply to the brain, correction of individual syndromes and symptoms. Citicoline (Neipilept) can be used to improve 
memory and cognitive functions, as one of the most promising neuroprotective drugs in terms of evidence-based medicine.
Key words: vertebrobasilar system, blood flow disturbance, transient ischemic attack, atherosclerosis, arterial hypertension, 
Neipilept.
