Cognitive impairment (CI) is one of the most urgent problems of modern medicine. According to projections of specialists, by 
2030 the number of people with dementia will double, and by 2050 — triple, and will be more than 130 million people. Patients 
with dementia require significant costs, and there is a trend to their further growth. In clinical practice, a patient with CI, as 
a rule, is a tough call for physicians of various specialties in both the diagnosis and selection of effective therapy. Far from 
every decrease in cognitive functions is steadily progressive and leads to the development of dementia. Timely manifestation 
and pathogenetically reasonable treatment administration are of crucial importance, because they contribute to the functional 
recovery of cerebral structures, and leads to reversible consequences. In recent years, the importance of differentiated and 
timely use of drugs of neuroprotective and metabolic action, the need for prolonged, possibly continuous use of drugs of this 
pharmacological direction, as well as the advisability of combinations of vasoactive and nootropic drugs with synergistic and 
additive effects, have been increasingly discussed.
