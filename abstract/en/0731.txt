Sarcoidosis  is  an  epitheliocellular  polyorganic  granulomatosis  of  unknown  nature,  the  prevalence  of  which  has  increased 
significantly  over  the  past  three  decades.  In  all  areas  of  medicine,  older  patients  are  a  problem,  primarily  associated  with 
polymorbidity.
Aim: compare patients with histologically confirmed sarcoidosis of a young (18–35 years) and older (55–75 years) age at the 
time of diagnosis (primary detection, before treatment).

Patients and Methods: the study consisted of a retrospective analysis of the database of patients observed by the authors of 
this publication in real clinical practice. The database was created in the SPSS-18 program. Statistical processing included the 
verification of the variation series for the normal distribution, the calculation of the mean, the error of the mean and standard 
deviation, the calculation of the conjugacy criterion CI-square (χ2), and the odds ratio.
1210 patients with sarcoidosis were examined during the primary detection between 1976 and 2017 (817 women and 393 men, 
67.5% / 32.5%), the age ranged from 12 to 76 years, an average of 42.36 ± 0.35 (12.1) years. A comparison of 190 patients with 
histologically confirmed sarcoidosis of a young age (18–35 years old) and 110 patients of the older age group (55–75 years) 
was made during the diagnosis (primary detection, before treatment).
Results: no differences were found in the radial stages of sarcoidosis, there was a slight tendency towards a greater number 
of cases of Löfgren’s syndrome in older patients. Complaints were more pronounced and were more frequent in patients of the 
senior group — 60% weakness vs. 45.1% in young patients (p<0.01), cough — 47.2% vs. 31.1% (p<0.01), dyspnea — 40.9% vs. 
24.4% (p<0.01), whereas the frequency of articular syndrome, fever, pain and discomfort in the chest did not differ. 60.6% of 
young patients were detected during fluorographic examination (vs. only 36.4%, p<0.001, in the elderly group). Diagnosis of 
sarcoidosis in young people was almost 2 times more often in TB dispensaries (40.9% vs 22.7%, p<0.001), in older patients —  
in oncology dispensaries (31.8% vs. 18.1%, p<0, 01). The treatment of patients did not differ, but in patients of the older age 
group the use of systemic glucocorticosteroids caused the adverse effects more often, and their effectiveness was lower.
Conclusion: the study showed that the age did not affect the frequency of occurrence of different radial stages of intrathoracic 
sarcoidosis  and  the  nature  of  the  therapy.  The  probability  of  revealing  sarcoidosis  when  handling  complaints  is  higher  in 
older patients due to the greater frequency of complaints, disturbances in the function of external respiration and external 
manifestations (sarcoidosis of the skin), they have a worse tolerance to the hormone therapy. Sarcoidosis in young patients 
was more often detected during preventive examinations and their diagnostic pathway often passed through anti-tuberculosis 
institutions.
Key words: sarcoidosis, age, diagnosis, radiation stages, comorbidity, treatment, adverse effects.
