In recent decades, the heart diseases caused by infectious endocarditis and rheumatic etiologies have become less common, giving the leading place to invo-
lutional (degenerative) cardiac valve damages. Ischemic mitral valve insufficiency (IMVI) is one of the most difficult and life-threatening complications of
CAD, arterial hypertension and other heart diseases, accompanied by left ventricular hypertrophy and/or dilatation of the left chambers of the heart. The ap-
pearance of IMVI adversely affect the prognosis of diseases, which depends on the degree of mitral regurgitation, increasing the risk of severe heart failure
and death. Currently, the dominant theory of the development of IMVI includes the remodeling of the left ventricle, the imbalance in the tension of the valve
leaflets, changes in the structure of the fibrous ring of the mitral valve. In the appropriate clinic echocardiography is the most informative and accessible
method of research in diagnostics of IMVI for the patients with the suspected defect. In the absence of effect from the drug therapy or delay in its beginning,
the most common correction of IMVI is mitral annuloplasty combined with the coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This article describes the etiological
factors, pathogenesis, diagnostic methods and treatment options of this severe disease.
Key words: ischemic mitral regurgitation, mitral valve prolapse, annulodilatation, left ventricular hypertrophy, pathogenesis, heart failure.
