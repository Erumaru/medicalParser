Summary
Avascular (or aseptic) necrosis (AN) occurs more frequently in men aged 35-45 and is bilateral. In 90% of patients, AN is mainly the result of alcohol abuse
and long-term therapy with glucocorticoids (GCs). Avascular necrosis of the femoral head when taking GCs is directly associated with their dose and dura-
tion of use. Non-traumatic osteonecrosis (ON) generally occurs when receiving the total dosage of GCs that is equivalent to 2 g or more of prednisolone for
2 or 3 months. The paper describes the clinical case of multiple non-traumatic osteonecrosis in a young man who received GCs for a relatively short period
of time.
Keywords: osteonecrosis, aseptic necrosis, avascular necrosis, glucocorticoids, side-effects of glucocorticoid therapy.
