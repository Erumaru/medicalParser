Aim. To analyze the efficacy and safety of golimubab in ulcerative colitis (UC).
Patients and methods. 13 UC patients (5 men and 8 women) aged 32-54 (on average, 44.5 ± 2.5 years) were examined. 5 of them were bio-naïve UC
patients. The efficacy of the therapy was assessed by Mayo score, hemoglobin level, leukocyte and thrombocyte counts, leukogram, ESR, crude protein, CRP,
serum iron, and faecal calprotectin levels at weeks 12, 26, and 56.
Results. 12 of 13 patients (92.3%) who responded to induction therapy proceeded to the maintenance treatment with golimubab. After 12 weeks, clinical re-
mission was achieved in 9 of 12 responders to golimubab (69.2%) while clinical endoscopic remission was achieved in 3 of 12 responders (23.1%). After 26
weeks an integrated analysis of the outcomes of induction and maintenance therapy with golimubab both in bio-naïve UC patients and UC patients who have
previously received engineered biologicals was performed. Clinical endoscopic remission was achieved in 50% of the patients (both bio-naïve individuals and
persons who have previously received infliximab). After 1 year of the treatment with golimubab 5 of 12 responders (41.6%) were in clinical remission and 6
of 12 responders (50.0%) were in clinical endoscopic remission. Total of five bio-naïve patients were in remission after 1 year while two patients who have
previously received infliximab have shown no response and UC relapse (15.4%). No severe or mild infectious complications or exacerbations of chronic in-
flammatory disorders were observed during 1-year follow-up.
Conclusions. Golimubab is effective and safe in daily clinical practice.
