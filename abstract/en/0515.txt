Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic progressive disease, which requires a comprehensive approach to its treatment, depending on the disease 
severity. An in­depth study of disease pathogenetic pathways has led to the awareness that OA includes several disease subtypes. The OA 
changing perception sets new goals for its treatment, namely, guidelines creation for a particular OA phenotype. At the latest ESCEO congress 
in 2019, held in Paris, data on updating the previous guidelines based on the GRADE evidence system and new systematic reviews, and meta­
analyses were presented. Treatment of patients with OA should be carried out using non­pharmacological and pharmacological methods 
combination.  The  updated  algorithm  for  treating  patients  with  OA  based  on  evidence­based  medicine  principles  offers  a  comprehensive 
approach to OA treatment. Adding that by using the GRADE evidence system it justifies the need for basic therapy with symptomatic slow­
acting drugs (SYSADOA) at the first treatment stage, with the stepwise prescription of drugs. It will certainly be useful for practicing physicians.
