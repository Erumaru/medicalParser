Over the last five years back pain has come to first place among the causes of disability and overall economic loss. In each 
case of the treatment of the patient with the back pain the main pathogenetic mechanism of pain should be determined. In 
each case, a thorough somatic and neurological follow-up examination is necessary. The article discusses the advantages of a 
multidisciplinary approach in the treatment of patients with chronic nonspecific back pain. The program of treatment, based 
on a combination of drug and non-pharmacological therapy, allows to get a significant analgesic effect. Particular attention 
in cases of chronic pain syndrome should be given to methods of cognitive-behavioral therapy and kinesiotherapy. Complex 
multidisciplinary approach in cases of chronic nonspecific back pain makes it possible to effectively stop pain syndrome, restore 
physical and social activity of patients. The clinical case, presented in the article, can serve as an evidence of the effectiveness 
of an integrated multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of chronic low back pain syndrome.
Key words: chronic back pain, multidisciplinary approach, cognitive-behavioral therapy.
