Aim:  to  analyze  clinical  pathogenic  value  of  soluble  complement  receptor  (C1qR1)  in  patients  with  chronic  spontaneous  urticaria  and  
to compare the findings with clinical characteristics of the disease.
Patients  and  Methods:  the  study  enrolled  49  patients  with  chronic  spontaneous  urticaria.  Group  1  included  36  patients  with  chronic 
spontaneous urticaria and angioedema (mean age 43.8±2.96 years). Group 2 included 13 patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria only 
(mean age 40.5±4.3 years). Control group included 34 healthy individuals (mean age 39.1±2.25 years). Serum C1qR1 concentration was 
measured by ELISA.
Results:  in  patients  with  chronic  spontaneous  urticaria  and  angioedema,  C1qR1  level  was  significantly  higher  than  in  patients  without 
angioedema (0.32±0.07 pg/mL and 0.17±0.05 pg/mL, respectively, p<0.05). In chronic spontaneous urticaria duration more than 5 years, 
C1qR1 concentration is significantly lower than in disease duration less than 5 years and 1 year to 5 years (0.09±0.02 pg/mL, 0.22±0.03 
pg/mL, and 0.41±0.16 pg/mL, respectively, p<0.05). Neither gender differences (0.24±0.04 pg/mL in women and 0.41±0.20 pg/mL in men, 
p>0.05)  nor  age  differences  (0.24±0.04  pg/mL  in  18–39  years,  0.18±0.04  pg/mL  in  40–59  years,  and  0.46±0.24  pg/mL  over  60  years, 
p>0.05) in C1qR1 levels were found in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria.
Conclusions:  it  was  demonstrated  for  the  first  time  that  soluble  receptors  to  C1q  component  are  involved  in  the  pathogenesis  chronic 
spontaneous urticaria. In more severe disease with angioedema, significant increase in C1qR1 levels was found as compared with chronic 
spontaneous urticaria without angioedema. Non-sedating antihistamines initially available in two dosages (e.g., ESPA-BASTIN®) are the 
optimal choice for resistant chronic spontaneous urticaria.
