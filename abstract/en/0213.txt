This article presents an analysis of key factors influencing the insulin therapy in patients with 2 type diabetes (DM 2 type). It is no secret that the technique
of injection of the drug can have a big impact on its therapeutic properties. The first expert board on the technique of insulin injections was organized in June
1997 in Strasbourg, France. In the next 20 years the key factors influencing the technique of drug injecting have been actively studied. This topic is extremely
important because, compared with the oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin therapy requires a serious training of patients with type 2 diabetes. A lot of latent
errors and problems during the insulin treatment of the patients with diabetes are caused by the lack of skills and knowledge about proper technique of in-
jection: they use long insulin needles with a high risk of intramuscular injections, make insulin injections into the areas of lipodystrophy, fail to observe the
time interval before the injection, reuse the needles, etc. A structured training of the patients helps to eliminate the gaps in their education and to achieve an
adequate diabetes control without increasing the cost of therapy.
Key words: technique of injection, insulin injection, lipodystrophy, patient training, diabetes control, conventional insulin.
