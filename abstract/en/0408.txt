Marshall syndrome (PFAPA syndrome) is characterized by periodic fevers with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis. In most patients, the episodes
of the disease recur for 4 to 8 years with the intervals between the recurrences of 2 to 12 weeks. The etiology of Marshall syndrome is still elusive. The dis-
ease usually manifests at age 5. However, in rare cases, the onset of this disorder occurs at age 40-50. Hereditary predisposition to Marshall syndrome is
not evident, therefore, this disease is not included into the group of periodic syndromes. Nevertheless, PFAPA syndrome is regarded as a periodic syndrome.
The paper discusses Marshall syndrome in 50-year woman with complaints of sore throat, joint pain, and episodes of fever and shivering. Considering high
titers of ASO and prior erysipelas inflammation, possible role of streptococcal infection was discussed.
The paper describes in detail diagnostic criteria for PFAPA syndrome and potential approaches to medical therapy. Case report illustrates differential diag-
nosis between Marshall syndrome and Still disease.
Key words: Marshall syndrome, PFAPA syndrome, periodic syndromes, fever, streptococcal infection.
