In clinical practice, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is often combined with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). According to the modern concepts, NAFLD
is the main component of the metabolic syndrome and the main risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This review discusses current aspects of the patho-
genesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, its relationship with type 2 diabetes and obesity, and association with a high risk of cardiovascular disease. Da-
ta on the clinical picture and instrumental methods of diagnosis of NAFLD are presented. The possibility of using essential phospholipids in the treatment of
NAFLD is considered as an effective, available and pathogenetically substantiated method of therapy. The article demonstrates the effectiveness of the es-
sential phospholipids therapy in improving the laboratory and ultrasound picture of the liver, reducing insulin resistance, systemic and tissue inflammation,
and the activity of fibrogenesis in the liver. It is shown that the treatment of NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes should start as early as possible, even at
the stage of steatosis, in this case one can expect the greatest effect from the therapy used. 
Key words: type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, pathogenesis, insulin resistance, fat function, diagnostics, essential phospholipids.
