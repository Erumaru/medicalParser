In Psychosomatic factors play a special role in the occurrence and course of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Visceral pains and motor disorders are charac-
teristic for functional diseases of the stomach and intestines, as well as other organs (pancreas, biliary tract and gallbladder). In some cases, such patients have
comorbid behavioral disorders: anxiety or depression. Depression as a result of chronic stress leads to anatomical and biochemical changes in the cortical and sub-
cortical structures of the brain, causing a disruption in the synthesis of serotonin and other neurotransmitters, affecting not only the gastrointestinal tract, but al-
so other functions of the autonomic nervous system. In such cases, functional gastrointestinal disorders can be determined by the disorder of the axis "gastroin-
testinal tract (GIT) - the brain". The central scheme of pain changes with the appearance of chronic stress, which also affects the change in motility and permeability
in the digestive tract. The choice of drugs for the treatment of these diseases should include psychotropic drugs, somatic neuroleptics and antidepressants.
Key words: psychosomatic disorders, gastroenterology, Rom–µ criteria IV, functional dyspepsia, syndrome of the angry intestines, neuroleptics, antidepressants.
