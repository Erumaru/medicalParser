MEN syndrome type 1 is a hereditary pathology characterized by the presence of two or more tumors (or hyperplasia) of the endocrine glands most com-
monly located in the parathyroid glands. This pathology is quite rare and poorly studied, however, given the high prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism
in the population, it requires certain knowledge for the treatment of such patients. Identification of patients at risk has an important prognostic significance,
because the disease is often diagnosed years after the occurrence of the first clinical symptoms, which may adversely affect the prognosis for the patient. It
is necessary to increase vigilance against this hereditary disease for a prompt screening and treatment, as well as comprehensive dynamic monitoring of pa-
tients with the syndrome of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. An integrated, multidisciplinary approach to patient management can improve the detection
of the disease and increase life expectancy. The article presents the clinical observation of a patient with syndrome of MEN 1 type and heterozygous substi-
tution s.1261T> C: r.S421R MEN1 gene, which hasn’t been described in the literature yet.
Key words: multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, primary hyperparathyreodism, hypercalcemia, parathyroid hormone, parathyroid glands, neuroendocrine
tumors, pituitary adenoma.
