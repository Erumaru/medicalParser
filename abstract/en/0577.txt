Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a heterogeneous group of clinical morphological variants of liver damage caused by the drugs in recommended standard
therapeutic doses due to the direct toxic (usually predictable), toxic immunological (idiosyncratic) or allergic effect. The range of clinical presentations is
wide and often similar to "classic" liver disorders. The diagnosis is based on a detailed history of the drugs used by a patient. Patients with moderate liver
damage undergoing long-term treatment with hepatotoxic drugs in outpatient care units should take silymarin to protect their liver against pharmaceuticals
as early as possible.
In most cases, hepatoprotective silymarin-containing drug with high bioavailability (Legalon) effectively prevents liver damage (in patients receiving drugs
with known hepatotoxic properties) or treats verified mild-to-moderate DILI. This agent inhibits liver fibrosis, recovers intrinsic liver antioxidant systems,
and provides anti-inflammatory, regenerative, and metabolic effects. Legalon should be taken throughout the treatment with hepatotoxic drug.
Key words: drug-induced liver injury, hepatoprotector, silybin, Legalon.
