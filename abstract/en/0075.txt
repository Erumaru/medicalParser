An acute pain syndrome or an increase in chronic pain is quite common in the practice of a clinician. At the same time, an acute pain even for a short-term
period can cause a lot of discomfort to patients. It is important to emphasize that in most cases untimely and inadequate treatment of acute pain transforms
it into a chronic one, which, in turn, complicates its correction. Knowledge of the mechanisms of the pain development can help the doctor to choose the treat-
ment and appropriate means for correcting painful sensations. One of the main tools for the treatment of acute and chronic pain in a wide range of diseases
and pathological conditions are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which have not only anti-inflammatory effects, but also influence both the
peripheral and the central mechanism of algesia. Thus, these drugs have a significant advantage over other symptomatic analgesic means not only in terms
of the therapeutic effect, but also in safety. Ketorol, a non-narcotic analgesic drug, has a pronounced rapid analgesic effect and a proven safety in short
therapy courses.
Key words: acute pain, algebra, pain correction, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, Ketorol.
