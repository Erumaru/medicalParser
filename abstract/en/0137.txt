The article presents data on the chemical composition and organoleptic properties of earwax, describes the diverse physiological 
value of earwax, and analyzes the diagnostic significance of the change in the composition of cerumen masses. Information on 
epidemiology is given, inevitable and avertible factors causing the formation of wax plug are listed. The variability of otoscopic 
data  is  described  in  detail,  the  main  and  probable  clinical  manifestations  of  wax  plug  are  named,  examples  of  syndromic 
diagnoses and possible complications are given. The conditions of a possible barometric trauma with a wax plug during deep 
diving are presented. It is indicated that the wax plug may lead to the possible conductive hearing loss, the appearance of ear 
noise and reflex cough. The modern ways of removing wax plug are listed and characterized: irrigation, aspiration, curettage, 
cerumenolysis. The author indicates the applicability of Otinum preparation for softening the cerumen masses, as well as for its 
topical application in external otitis. The domestic and professional conditions, which increase the probability of the wax plug 
formation, are listed. The article indicates the need to use modern hygienic products for the timely and correct cleaning the 
external auditory canal to prevent ceruminosis and inflammatory diseases of the outer ear.
Key words: earwax, ceruminosis, wax plug, Otinum, external otitis.
