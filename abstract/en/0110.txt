Currently, individual treatment choice for painful diabetic neuropathy is challenging due to the lack of comparative clinical trials of treatment efficacy with
sufficient statistical power and follow-up as well as limited and controversial outcomes of various treatments. Most current guidelines recommend three ma-
jor treatment approaches to this condition, i.e., diabetes therapy improvement, medications, and non-medical treatment. The paper summarizes major ther-
apeutic algorithms for painful distal diabetic neuropathy, highlights the importance of blood glucose normalizing, and discusses medications for this condi-
tion and additional non-medical treatments. Major medications for painful distal diabetic neuropathy are tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, opioids, B vitamins and alpha lipoic acid. Mechanisms of their action, treatment regimens (therapeutic and
maximum tolerated doses, principles of dose titration), adverse side effects, and precautions are discussed.
Key words: diabetes, complications, distal neuropathy, neuropathic pain, treatment approaches to  neuropathic pain.
