Sleep disorders require careful complex examination considering detailed sleep charac-teristics, somatic and psychological aspects. Non-drug 
therapies which eliminate unfavorable factors affecting normal sleep and relaxation should be the priority treatment for these disorders. Short-
course drug therapy should be prescribed in severe cases only when insomnia significantly affects vital activity. The paper describes in detail 
diagnostic criteria for insomnia based on In-ternational Classification of Sleep Disorders (2nd and 3rd edition) and International Classification 
of Diseases (10th and 11th edition). The authors review clinical variants of insomnia and currently recommended diagnostic algorithm for sleep 
disorders. Treatment strategies (i.e., non-drug ther-apies, pharmacotherapy, and cognitive behavioral treatment) are highlighted. In addition to 
hyp-notics (which efficacy has been demonstrated), popular over-the-counter medications for insom-nia providing sedative hypnotic effect are 
discussed. Camphor bromide can be recommended as an alternative to popular phenobarbital-containing drugs for patients with insomnia and 
cardio-logic comorbidities. These data are useful for general practitioners who diagnose and manage sleep disorders.
