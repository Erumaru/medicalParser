Osteoporosis and related low-energy fractures require early customized medical prevention and treatment with vitamin D. Alfacalcidol, active metabolite of
vitamin D, increases bone mineral density and decreases the risk of fractures in primary and secondary osteoporosis. Unlike native vitamin D, alfacalcidol pro-
vides more significant fracture risk reduction. Active vitamin D metabolites can be prescribed as a prevention and treatment for osteoporosis in patients re-
ceiving long-term peroral corticosteroids. Alfacalcidol but not vitamin D is indicated for the prevention of falls, one of the major factors affecting fracture risks,
in particular, in elderly persons. Alfacalcidol can be used with biphosphonates to provide better outcomes of osteoporosis treatment or as monotherapy in an-
ti-resorption treatment withdrawal. The safety of alfacalcidol is similar to that of cholecalciferol. Customized dosing minimizes the risks of side-effects.
Key words: osteoporosis, fractures, bone mineral density, fall, risk, vitamin D, alfacalcidol, muscle mass.
