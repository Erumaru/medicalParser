Nowadays, the problem of chronic dermatoses prevalence remains relevant. Typically, chronic dermatoses occur in the setting of somatic 
pathology, aggravating the skin process manifestation. The autonomic nervous system condition in patients with chronic dermatoses remains 
poorly understood. In this regard, the studying aspect of the relationship between autonomic status condition parameters in patients with 
chronic dermatoses and skin process manifestations is relevant. The study group included patients with skin and subcutaneous fat diseases 
(class  XII  for  ICD­10).  The  selection  criteria  concerned  chronic  non­infectious  dermatoses.  The  study  involved  20  patients  (13  men  and 
7 women of the average age 35.7 years old) with a history of chronic dermatoses: 10 of them with psoriasis, 10 — with eczema. Family history 
in dermatology was observed in four. Several somatic diseases presence in one patient, i.e. comorbidity, was observed in 7 subjects (35%). In 
16 patients (75%), a distinctive fact was the vagotonia predominance, and in 4 (25%) — eutonia. Thus, the conducted studies allow concluding 
that the parasympathetic nervous system prevails in patients with chronic dermatoses.
