The paper describes the stages of human voice maturation and the classification of its disorders. Complaints of patients with voice disorders at different pe-
riods of childhood as well as the causes of dysphonia in the context of age are discussed. Special attention is given to the infantile voice. In patients with
hoarseness of any age, laryngeal endoscopy is required. The prevalence of inflammatory disorders of larynx in patients with acute respiratory viral infec-
tions is assessed. Authors’ data on the prevalence of different types of laryngitis in children are presented. The importance of endoscopy for the diagnosis of
laryngitis is demonstrated. The authors concluded that the prevalence of different types of laryngitis in acute respiratory viral infections ranges from 8.7%
to 38%, and 91.3% of them are children with recurrent laryngitis (including obstructive). Principles of patient management are reviewed. The data on clini-
cal efficacy of treatment and preventive approaches to dysphonia which include homeopathy (i.e., Homeovox) are presented. Considering that the prevalence
of functional dysphonia increases with age, it is reasonable to prescribe Homeovox preventively, particularly in patients with recurrent laryngitis following
acute respiratory viral infections and in individuals of professions with heavy vocal loading.
Key words: voice disorders in children, stages of voice maturation, changes in vocal timbre, dysphonia, causes of dysphonia, laryngitis, complex homeopathic
remedies, Homeovox.
