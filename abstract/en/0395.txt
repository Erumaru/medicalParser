Over the past decade, incretin-based therapy has become one of the priority areas of drug therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The im-
portance and necessity of realization of incretin effects in maintaining glucose homeostasis is well studied and proven, which makes the incretin-based ther-
apy the most promising one in the modern management algorithms for type 2 diabetes (drugs do not cause hypoglycemic reactions, provide a predictable,
glucose-dependent hypoglycemic effect, have a wide range of positive non-glycemic effects). Despite the high effectiveness of the incretin drugs in the ma-
jority of patients, the hypothesis of their ability to restore the impaired incretin effects is widespread but not fully justified. In type 2 diabetes, the endocrine
part of the pancreas retains sensitivity to GLP-1, but becomes resistant to the influence of the GIP, which apparently is the main reason for the decrease or
absence of incretin effects. The incretin-directed therapy stimulates the GLP-1 receptors and thus increases insulin secretion in response to oral and intra-
venous glucose stimulation, thereby eliminating the potential differences between these stimuli, but not restoring the incretin defects in the patients.
Key words: diabetes mellitus type 2, incretins, hypoglycemia.
