Ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS)  is  a  chronic  inflammatory  disease  involving  spine,  peripheral  joints  and  extra-articular 
manifestations. AS is often combined with psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases, forming a group of «seronegative 
spondyloarthropathies».  The  treatment  goals  for  spondyloarthritis  are  maintenance  of  physical  function,  control 
of  disease  activity  and  prevention  of  X  ray  progression.  However,  not  like  the  well-established  treat-to-target  (T2T) 
guidance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the T2T concept for treating AS is still immature. Clinical evidence of T2T in AS  
is still lacking.
To develop the foundations of the T2T strategy in the AS, several research agendas need to be accomplished: to develop 
and formulate a generally accepted measureable treatment target, defined through experts’ consensus; develop a clear 
algorithm for monitoring disease activity and adjusting therapy; well-designed comparative clinical trials to compare 
this  T2T  strategy  with  the  current  standard  of  treatment  should  be  conducted  to  demonstrate  long-term  benefits  
and risks.
Key words: ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, remission, activity, treat-to-target.
