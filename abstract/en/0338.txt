The  article  is  devoted  to  the  study  of  vertical  nystagmus  as  a  sign  of  central  vestibular  disorders  in  neurological  and 
otorhinolaryngological practice. Vertical nystagmus is believed to indicate central vestibular disorders. The modern models 
that explain its mechanism are outlined. Based on the literature data, the requirements for the evaluation of this pathology are 
discussed.
Own observations of vertical nystagmus in 5 patients, obtained during the examination of 60 patients with complaints of dizziness, 
which were conducted in the departments of otorhinolaryngology and maxillofacial surgery of Nikiforov All­Russian Center for 
Emergency and Radiation Medicine, are given. Registration of spontaneous nystagmus in the course of an otoneurological 
examination was carried out using video­oculography.
It is noted that vertical nystagmus was rarely detected in the examined patients (in 5 out of 60), which can be explained by the 
fact that patients with peripheral vestibular pathology dominate in otorhinolaryngological practice. It was detected only in 
the dark and was detected in patients with central vestibular disorders. It is discussed that the common factors of its change 
in positional samples (when placed on the back, turning in this position of the head to the side, etc.) for problems of topical 
diagnosis require further study. The article is addressed to the attention of neurologists and otorhinolaryngologists.
Key words: vertical nystagmus, vestibular dysfunction, vestibuloocular reflex, videooculography, central vestibular disorders.
