A  literature  review  is  given  on  the  evaluation  of  the  therapeutic  potential  of  acetyl-L-carnitine  (ALC)  (Carnicetine)  in  the 
treatment of cognitive and depressive disorders in elderly patients. ALC is a brain-specific derivative of L-carnitine, it is an 
easily accessible substrate for triggering volatile metabolic processes in the mitochondries, supplying the acetyl group directly 
to the mitochondrial matrix to synthesize acetyl coenzyme A without consuming ATP and oxygen. By improving the energy 
supply of neurons in conditions of reduced oxygen consumption, ALC protects neurons from ischemic hypoxia.  A number of 
experimental studies have also established the antioxidant effect of ALC. ALC reduces free radicals formation and promotes the 
preservation of ATP.
Due to structural similarity with acetylcholine, it has a cholinomimetic effect, and also modulates the activity of dopaminergic 
and serotonergic systems. Pharmaceutic preparations  based on L-carnitine and ALC refer to energy-consuming agents that 
can restore the damaged cellular energy metabolism. This article describes the mechanisms of action of the drug, assessed the 
effectiveness and safety of its use in gerontological practice. Analysis of the results of preclinical and clinical studies of ALC in 
the world medical practice is given.
Key words: late age, dementia, cognitive disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, treatment, acetyl-L-carnitine, Carnicetine.
