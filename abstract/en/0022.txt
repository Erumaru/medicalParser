Hypertension is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases. Its prevalence in women is 54.45% and is slightly inferior to that of in men. In the over-55s,
the prevalence of hypertension increases to 74.5% and is superior to that of in men (72.3%). 55-64 years are postmenopausal age (after the last menstrual
period) which marks the permanent loss of ovarian functions and leads to estrogen deficiency. Estrogen deficiency which is of crucial importance for hyper-
tension directly results in reduced production of potent vasodilators and antiplatelet factors (i.e., nitric oxide and prostacyclin), activation of local (tissue)
renin-angiotensin and sympathetic systems, sodium retention, and insulin resistance. Neurohumoral changes due to menopause result in salt-sensitive hy-
pertension. Current guidelines for hypertension include major principles of its therapy in postmenopausal women. Diuretics (single or in combination with
other drugs, in particular, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockers) are a rational treatment strategy in these patients.
Key words: hypertension, postmenopausal period, hypertension in women, estrogen deficiency, diuretics, torasemide, Diuver.
