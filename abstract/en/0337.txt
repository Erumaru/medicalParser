Acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI)  — the common pathology that occurs regardless of age, place of residence and 
social status of a person. The entrance gates of the body for the virus — an upper respiratory tract, most often through the 
nasal mucous membranes. With long­term acute inflammation of the nasal mucous membranes, complications may develop 
with the formation of chronic processes: irreversible changes of the paranasal sinuses and nasal mucous membranes devel­
op in addition to bacterial inflammation and persistence of mucosal edema. Therefore, it is advisable to carry out not only 
symptomatic, but also anti­inflammatory and antimicrobial therapy of rhinitis in a timely manner. The article reviewed the 
studies evaluating the effectiveness of the components of the nasal spray Euphorbium compositum Nasentropfen S®. Due to 
the wide range of a complex effect, this drug can be recommended for the treatment of various forms of rhinitis. Euphorbium 
compositum Nasentropfen S® has antiedematous, antiviral, immunomodulatory and antibacterial action, suitable for irriga­
tion therapy during the epidemiological risk of ARVI. To achieve the best result, the drug should be used at the first signs of 
incipient ARVI.
Key words: rhinitis, antiviral effect, symptomatic therapy, bioregulatory medicine, Euphorbium compositum Nasentropfen S®.
