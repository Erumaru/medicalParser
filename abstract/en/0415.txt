A clinical case of the Cushing's syndrome, diagnosed and treated during pregnancy, resulted in the child's birth on time. Cushing's syndrome is a condition
that arises from prolonged exposure to the body of excessive secretion of cortisol by the adrenal cortex, and is extremely rare in pregnant women. At the very
beginning of the disease, the clinical picture of hypercorticism is not always clear and the diagnosis is often delayed, and during pregnancy it is more diffi-
cult to suspect the Cushing’s syndrome, because the detected changes may be related to the course of pregnancy. In the described case, the characteristic
changes were noticed even before the onset of pregnancy, which allowed to suspect hypercorticism, despite the referral diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus,
and to conduct appropriate follow-up examination. The woman received surgical treatment at the 19th week of gestation, which allowed to preserve and pro-
long the pregnancy, and to stabilize the mother's condition. Subsequently, after delivery, insulin therapy was discontinued, the absence of carbohydrate me-
tabolism abnormalities was confirmed, antihypertensive therapy was abolished, weight loss was noted.
Early detection of endogenic hypercorticism allows to provide relatively safe surgical treatment and improves prognosis for the mother and child.
Key words: сushing’s syndrome, pregnancy, adrenalectomy, hypercorticism, diabetes mellitus.
