At present, the term «toxic talk» is more and more often used in the scientific community. This is not accidental. Numerous 
epidemiological studies, aimed at determining the reliable relationship between the radiation from a mobile phone and the risk 
of developing a brain tumor, are becoming increasingly important every year. The article presents an analysis of literature data 
on the effect of mobile phones on the risk of developing various brain tumors. It is shown, that in studies with a sufficient number 
of observations and carefully selected control groups there are statistically significant differences in the risk of developing brain 
tumors between individuals, who use mobile devices, and those who do not use them. Differences are most clearly manifested 
when the period of using a mobile device is 10 years or more. It was also revealed, that the most significant differences are 
established for tumors on the side of using mobile devices. Thus, the obtained data allow to attribute the radiation from mobile 
phones to the risk factors for brain tumors — acoustic neuroma, glioma and meningioma.
Key words: mobile phones, mobile devices, brain tumors, acoustic neuroma, glioblastoma, meningioma.
