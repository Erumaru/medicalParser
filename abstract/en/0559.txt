This study illustrates the evaluation of the treatment of  patients with lung neoplasms of various nature and sizes in the IIBS clinic performed on two types
of linear accelerators.
Patients and methods: from December 2011 to February 2017, 71 patients with total 103 primary and metastatic formations of the lungs  were treated. Of
all the tumors, 37 were central and 66 were peripheral; patients receiving treatment for primary lung tumors were refused a surgical treatment. Treatment
was carried out on two types of linear accelerators: CyberKnife (CK) (with the use of the Synchrony Breathing System for 38 (59.4%) out of 64 tumors) and
TrueBeam STx (TB) (with the use of the Gating Breathing System on the area of   39 tumors).
Results: the observation group consisted of 50 patients with 71 lung formations. The average volume of tumors was 44.7 cm3 (0.2-496.5 cm3). Median obser-
vation was 7 months (1-57 months). Local control was achieved in 100% of cases, median duration of control was 6 months (1-57 months). Local control was
maintained even in most cases of systemic progression of the underlying disease. For 19 (26,8%) formations, according to the results of treatment, a complete
response was achieved, the median of which was 5 months (1-47 months). Continued growth was observed in 16 (22.5%) cases, 15 of which were primary
tumors. The frequency of early toxicity (cough, dyspnea) in CK treatment was lower (8% vs. 19% for TB), most patients did not exceed grade II severity, com-
plications of grade III toxicity were observed in 5 patients. The frequency of late radiation complications did not differ in patients receiving treatment on both
linear accelerators and did not exceed the grade II in all patients. Early and late radiation complications of grade IV were not observed in any patient. 1-, 2-
and 3-year overall survival was 83.6, 77.3 and 65.8%, respectively.
Conclusion: stereotactic radiotherapy allows to achieve and maintain local control in the majority of patients at a sufficiently low incidence of radiation
complications. When irradiating primary lung tumors, higher doses may be more effective in achieving and maintaining local control.
