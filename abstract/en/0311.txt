The paper discusses differential diagnostic aspects of acute pelvic pain. It is generally accepted that psychogenic factor is the key component of pain. How-
ever, in every case, major pathogenic mechanisms of pain development and maintenance should be identified. The author proposes differential diagnostic
criteria for pelvic pain of various etiology and reports on clinical cases. Careful collection of anamnestic data is required. The nature and specifics of pain
onset in different cases should be uncovered as well. Case reports demonstrate that clinical manifestations of spinal disc herniation are more relevant than
imaging data (MRI). Minimal diagnostic criteria for clinical manifestations and anamnesis are required as well to reduce the range of potential examinations
and to narrow diagnostic focus. The efficacy of traditional medical approaches (i.e., osteopathy, leech therapy, homeopathy including Traumeel, Discus
compositum, and Zeel T) is highlighted.
Key words: pelvic pain, osteochondrosis, spinal disc herniation, differential diagnosis of pelvic pains, pelvic neurosis, coccygodynia, pelvic vein dilatation,
traditional medicine, discogenic radiculopathy.
