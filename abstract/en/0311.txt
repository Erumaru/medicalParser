NSAIDs are amongst the most popular medical agents with broad spectrum of indications for use. They acts via inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins
which play the key pathogenic role in inflammation, pain, and fever. Cyclooxygenase (COG) is the major molecular target for NSAIDs. Lornoxicam inhibits
both COG isoenzymes, i.e., COG-1 and COG-2, and is therefore nonselective NSAID. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lornoxicam account for its
high efficacy and safety. Its analgesic effect is similar or superior to most NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin etc.). Unlike other analgesics, lornoxi-
cam is a potent anti-inflammatory agent. In addition, its tolerability is superior to other nonselective NSAIDs. Lornoxicam can be prescribed by different spe-
cialists to reduce pain of any origin regardless of its severity. Good safety profile and anti-inflammatory activity allow to use this agent for many inflamma-
tory and degenerative disorders of musculoskeletal system. Various formulations of lornoxicam improve adherence to treatment.
