Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental illnesses that often accompany severe somatic diseases, including 
oncologic pathology. Approximately 30% of patients with cancer suffer from any form of mental disorder, most often — anxiety 
or depression. The risk of anxiety disorders among both persons with present cancer and recovered from these diseases is 
higher than the average for the population. Meanwhile, anxiety disorders are often not recognized as a specific pathology that 
requires special attention and long-term adequate treatment, which leads not only to chronicity of mental disorders, but also 
may adversely affect the prognosis of cancer. This article discusses the features of anxiety disorders in patients with cancer, 
diagnostic methods and their correction.
Key words: anxiety, depression, affective disorders, cancer, tofisopam, buspirone.
