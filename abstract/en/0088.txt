There is a multi-level system for protecting the body from foreign infectious and chemical agents, known as «mucosa-associated 
lymphoid  tissue»  (MALT),  in  the  barrier  tissues  (mucosa  and  skin).  It  includes  humoral  factors  and  cells  of  congenital  and 
adaptive immunity, as well as non-immune defense mechanisms. One of the important components of protecting barrier tissues 
is the microbiota, whose commensals, on the one hand, carry out metabolic function and direct anti-pathogenic activity, and, on 
the other hand, constantly stimulate MALT at different levels and, thus, support the immunity of barrier tissues in the state of 
«smoldering activation” and readiness for a rapid response to the invasion of foreign organisms or substances. Antibiotics, being 
one of the most frequently prescribed medications, disrupt the number, composition and activity of symbiotic microorganisms. 
As a consequence, the immunity of barrier tissues is weakened, which contributes to the colonization of mucous and skin by 
pathogenic microorganisms and, in particular, their antibiotic-resistant strains. Awareness of this fact requires a change in the 
tactics of prescribing antibiotics and the introduction of additional medications to maintain MALT activity. Candidate drugs to 
supplement etiotropic anti-infective therapy are microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMP) or, that is more real from the 
pharmacologycal point of view, their minimal biologically active fragments (MBAF).
Key words: mucosal immunity, microbiota, antibiotics, immunosuppression, infections, antibiotic resistance, immunomodulation, 
replacement therapy.
