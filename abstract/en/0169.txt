Migration of the metal fixator is not a typical complication of osteosynthesis operations, and as a result, it can cause significant diagnostic problems (due to
migration of the fixator to adjacent areas, and in rare cases, distant anatomical regions), as well as create a threat to the lives of patients, damaging vital
organs and major vessels. In particular, the metal structures of the proximal femur under the influence of muscle contractions and changes in the position of
the body can migrate to the gluteal region. There are publications describing their migration into the small pelvis and the perineal region. Each of these com-
plications can have either a typical course, or its own special scenario.
The article describes a casuistic clinical case of a patient admitted to the hospital with complaints of hemoptysis, pain in the left hypochondrium region,
within 2 days. As a result of the examination, a migration of the metal fixator of the right femur cervix into the left lung complicated by pulmonary hemorrhage
was revealed. The patient underwent surgical treatment.
Key words: migration, osteosynthesis, clinical case, pulmonary hemorrhage.
