Traumeel is a homeopathic medicinal product that is applied according to bioregulatory principles derived from a homotoxicological approach and, therefore,
also called antihomotoxic preparation. Traumeel is used for the adjuvant or stand-alone treatment of inflammatory diseases of different organs and tissues,
including, in particular, of the musculoskeletal system (tendovaginitis, bursitis, styloiditis, epicondylitis, periarthritis, etc.), and post-traumatic conditions
(post-operative swelling of soft tissues, strains, sprains). 
The objective of this study was to obtain an overview of the evidence on the use of Traumeel for its main registered indication as stated above. 
Methods. This review applied an integrative, «mixed methods» approach with regard to the available data on Traumeel. This involved grading the level of ev-
idence using one of the classical hierarchical evidence grading systems and complementing this by a non-hierarchical assessment of the available data.
Results. Twenty-two studies were selected, including three review papers; six clinical; seven prospective cohort studies; seven basic research studies.
Conclusion. The available data on Traumeel suggest that there is a growing and multifaceted evidence base for this product. In our opinion, obtaining such
an integrative, multifaceted perspective on the available evidence provides significant added value as a source for informing individualized patient care.
