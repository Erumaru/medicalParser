Nowadays, there is a need for reliable screening methods for examining healthy people to identify potential patients with epilepsy, as these 
methods are not developed in the world practice. An epilepsy diagnosis feature is a prevalence of the history and clinical examination over 
laboratory study results. Laboratory studies in patients with epilepsy contribute to the hidden pathological process manifestation, characterize 
the patient’s condition, affect the diagnosis and treatment pattern, and have predictive value. In addition, these studies with determined 
epilepsy diagnosis are used to measure anti­epileptic drug’s (AEP) concentration in the blood plasma and to monitor possible therapy side 
effects.  Conducting  research  without  specific  goals  is  impractical.  Patients  who  do  not  present  active  somatic  problems,  unlike  high­risk 
patients, do not need more in­depth laboratory studies. Nevertheless, being an auxiliary method for epilepsy diagnosis, laboratory tests are 
an integral part of a patient’s condition comprehensive assessment.
Keywords: epilepsy, diagnosis, tests, laboratory, anti­epileptic drugs.
