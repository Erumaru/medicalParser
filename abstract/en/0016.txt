Nerve injury in the structure of traumatic pathology is not as common as injuries of other organs and tissues. However, if not 
timely conduct a diagnosis and radical treatment, an injured limb may lose its function, despite the efforts made to restore the 
injured bones, muscles and vessels. Despite the development of medical science, the treatment of nerve injury has not been 
improved for several decades. In addition to the treatment of nerve injuries, it is necessary to revise the set of organizational and 
methodological approaches, as well as to improve the surgical technique and apply modern materials for surgical treatment. 
It should be noted that in the event of disability in case of a nerve injury, the patient is doomed to long-term rehabilitation, 
permanent disability, which has a negative social and economic effect both for the victim and for the state. The author has 
studied the existing algorithms for the treatment of nerve injury and clarified the most pressing problems. During the analysis 
of pathological features of nerve injury and evaluation of existing methods of surgical treatment, a summary of the results of 
many different studies was made as well as suggestions to solve the problems of surgical treatment of nerve injury at all levels.
Key words: nerve injury, neurotraumatology, neuroimplant, nerve treatment, treatment standards, nerve tubulization.
