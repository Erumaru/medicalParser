Erectile dysfunction (ED) is common in the population and significantly affects the life of a man and his sexual partner.
Aim. To analyze the assessment of sex life by the partners of men with ED before and after the treatment with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors.
Patients and methods. Monocentric cohort study included 128 men aged 32–54 years with mild and moderate ED. All patients received sildenafil 50 mg tak-
en as needed for 3 months. Patients’ wives were interviewed on the quality of the treatment of their husbands. Study endpoint was the analysis of this as-
sessment.
Results. 83 patients (64.84%) reported on the positive effect of sildenafil. 43 wives agreed to answer the questions. At baseline, 38 wives (88.37%) rated their
sex life with the partner as «bad», however, 5 women did not consider husband’s ED as an issue due to their own low «sexual appetite». After 3-month treat-
ment with sildenafil, 19 women (44.18%) rated the sex life as «good» and 22 women (51.16%) as «excellent». 2 women (4.65%) reported on no changes thus
demonstrating that strong erection does not guarantee better sex life.
Conclusions. Sildenafil plays two important roles in woman’s life. First (direct role), it improves reproductive status. Second (indirect role), it improves sex-
ual life through the stronger erection of a sexual partner. 95.35% of women were satisfied with sildenafil treatment of the partner.
Key words: sildenafil, erectile dysfunction, female sexual dysfunction, prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, treatment of erectile dysfunction.
