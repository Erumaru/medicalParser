Insulin resistance (IR) is the main cause of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2) development. The IR basis is a biological response violation of tissues 
to insulin — a hormone that regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and mitogenic processes. In DM 2, a compensatory 
increase in insulin secretion (the so­called basal hyperinsulinemia) triggers a cascade of metabolic disorders in connection with IR. Chronic 
hyperinsulinemia reduces the number of insulin­sensitive receptors on target cells, resulting in increased IR. When choosing drug therapy for 
DM 2, aimed at reducing IR in the elderly, one should be guided not only by the drug effectiveness but also by its safety and good tolerability. 
Whereas age itself is not a contraindication to the use of any drugs. Subetta can be considered as a new drug with a unique mechanism of 
action for the DM 2 treatment as part of complex therapy with other oral hypoglycemic drugs.
Keywords: diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hypoglycemic drugs, release activity, Subetta.
