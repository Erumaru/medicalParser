The high prevalence, the tendency to increase the incidence rate not only in Russia, but also in all countries of the world, the chronic recurrent course and a
significant impact on the quality of patients’ life, the difficulties of diagnosis and the complexity of treatment of GERD distinguish it among other types of
pathology of the digestive system. However, in the practice of a clinician there are quite often the patients who have 3-5 diagnoses with the prevalence of
symptoms of the underlying disease in the clinical picture, whereas the GERD clinic can remain "in the shadow". In addition, often in polymorbid patients, es-
pecially of older age groups, there is a discrepancy between the symptoms of GERD and the endoscopic picture of the disease, which often leads to the late
treatment - already at the stage of complications of the disease. The therapeutic approach to the treatment of GERD in case of polymorbidity and polyphar-
macy requires administration of effective, cost-efficient, and safe medicines with the minimum risk of adverse drug interactions. Due to the composition and
mechanism of action the use of preparation Gaviscon DD is effective and safe in the polymorbid patients, including the older age groups.
Key words: gastroesophageal reflux disease, polymorbid patient, Gaviscon DD.
