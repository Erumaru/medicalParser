Diabetes is the most common endocrine disorder. Diabetic skin which is a metabolically active organ is exposed to typical metabolic disturbances (i.e., hyper-
glycemia, hyperlipidemia etc.), chronic cardiovascular complications, diabetic neuropathy etc. Infection-related skin lesions result from antimicrobial leuko-
cyte reaction suppression due to reduced leukocyte chemotactic and phagocytic functions, decreased insulin-dependent interleukin production, and inability of
leukocytes to migrate across thickened endothelium. The paper reviews the most common diabetic skin lesions which occur in advanced diabetes or precede the
disease. The lecture will help endocrinologists and dermatologists in early diagnosis, effective treatment and prevention of skin lesions in diabetes.
Key words: diabetes, cheiroarthropathy, scleroderma, granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica, lichen ruber planus, Grinspan's syndrome.
