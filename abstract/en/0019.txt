The article reviews the data of modern foreign and domestic literature on the use of piribedil as one of the dopamine agonists 
for the main indications: Parkinson’s disease, moderate cognitive impairment and sensory deficiency in elderly patients. Such 
a multiple use of this drug is due to its unique mechanisms of action that distinguish it from other dopamine agonists. The 
mechanisms of action of the drug are discussed. The data of the main clinical studies of the efficacy and safety of piribedil 
are  given.  The  Movement  Disorder  Society  (MDS-EBM)  estimates  that  pyribedil  is  «effective»  and  «clinically  useful»  for 
the symptomatic treatment of patients at the early stages of Parkinson’s disease both as monotherapy and in combination 
with  levodopa.  The  drug  reduces  the  main  motor  symptoms  of  parkinsonism,  and  also  has  a  positive  effect  on  non-motor 
disorders: depression, apathy, cognitive decline. The positive effect of piribedil on cognitive function has been shown in more 
than  10  foreign  clinical  trials  involving  about  7000  patients  and  in  a  significant  number  of  domestic  works.  This  effect  is 
successfully used in various types of cognitive disorders, both neurodegenerative and vascular, of mild to moderate severity.
Key words: moderate cognitive impairment, Parkinson’s disease, dopamine agonists, piribedil, Pronoran.
