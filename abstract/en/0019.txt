The history of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and its medical use stretches back to the antiquity when Galen and Hippocrates used willow bark and other salicy-
late-rich plants to reduce pain. Single use of ASA in low doses is a standard secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Despite long-term use of ASA
in cardiology, recent findings have aroused logical interest in more efficient treatment regimens with ASA and/or relationship between treatment efficacy and
timing ASA (the concept of chronotherapy). Cardiomagnyl (Takeda), ASA (effective and safe doses are 75 mg and 150 mg) in combination with non-absorbed
antacid (magnesium hydroxide), is one of the most effective ASA formulations. Magnesium hydroxide acts as a rapid-action antacid which does not affect
ASA absorption. Medical use of ASA is still an important issue. Novel findings from the studies will improve our knowledges and practice recommendations.
Key words: acetylsalicylic acid, cardiovascular diseases, cardiovascular risk, cardiology, chronotherapy, Cardiomagnyl.
