Depression and cognitive disorders often coexist in clinical practice. On the one hand, depression can be the first symptom of  developing dementia in
Alzheimer's disease or chronic cerebral ischemia. On the other hand, cognitive dysfunction is the obligatory part of depression.
The paper presents differential diagnosis of these conditions. Cognitive dysfunctions nature is discussed (e.g. monoamines deficiency or hippocampus atro-
phy) as well as main features of clinical symptoms: poor concentration, memory loss, decreased psychomotor speed, executive function disorders are spe-
cific for cognitive dysfunction while less severe depression, atypical course, inability of patients to describe symptoms in details are more typical for
Alzheimer's disease. Specific diagnostic tests are proposed to reveal cognitive dysfunction in patients with depression (Scale for depression assessment in de-
mentia) and depression in patients with dementia (e.g., Cornell scale).
The paper also presents treatment approaches of depression depending on presence of cognitive dysfunctions and depressive episode. Special attention is paid
to non-drug therapy (cognitive-behavioral, creative art  and color therapies, ergotherapy, a diet rich in polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins and
folic acid, tryptophan, slow-carb diet).
Key words: depression, cognitive dysfunctions, dementia, antidepressants
