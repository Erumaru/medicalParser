The article contains data on causes of pain syndromes (PS) involving the trunk and the extremities, with more detailed description of PS in the regions of
shoulder girdle and upper extremities. Neurophysiological, pathophysiological and clinical aspects are reviewed with regard to causes and peculiarities of
acute and chronic (lasting at least three months) pain. Differentiation diagnostics between neurogenic and non-neurogenic PS is presented, based on aman-
mestic features. Importance of distinguishing organic and psychogenic causes of PS is discussed. The author describes causes, frequency and clinical signs
of the following syndromes: herniation of the intervertebral disc (HID) and spondylosis of the neck, degenerative changes in the joints of the cervical spine,
neuralgic amyotrophy of the shoulder, nocturnal meralgia paresthetica, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Clinical characteristics of different types
of CRPS are given, as well as prevalence and diagnostic features of CRPS. Results of investigations are shown, concerning usage of different forms of
Ketorol in treatment of PS. Ketorol renders significantly strong analgesic action and can be used for effective termination of various PS in both in- and out-
patient setting.
Key words: pain syndromes in the region of shoulder girdle and upper extremities, Ketorol.
