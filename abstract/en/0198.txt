Modern pancreatology is a dynamically developing branch of gastroenterology, that naturally results in a growing number of national (including Russia)
guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic pancreatitis (CP), characterized by conflicting or ambiguous recommendations. To compensate such in-
consistencies there was taken a decision to make the first European clinical protocol, compiled with observance of the principles of the evidence-based med-
icine and containing scientifically grounded recommendations on key aspects of conservative and surgical treatment of CP. Twelve interdisciplinary expert
working groups (EWG) made systematic literature reviews on the pre-formulated clinical questions. Various ERGs considered the CP etiology, CP diagnos-
tics tools using imaging techniques, diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, surgical, medical and endoscopic treatment, as well as issues of treatment
of pancreatic pseudocysts, pancreatic pain, malnutrition and nutrition, pancreatogenic diabetes, natural history of disease and quality of life at CP.  The aims
of writing this article were the coverage of the main provisions of this consensus, which are in demand among gastroenterologists, their analysis and the need
to adapt them to Russian clinical practice.
Key words: chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, diagnosis, treatment, pancreatin preparations.
