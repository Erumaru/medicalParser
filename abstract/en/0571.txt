According to the World Health Organization, about 20% of the world’s population are affected by mycoses. Currently, the mankind experiences an outbreak
of opportunistic infections, and mycoses are among the leading causes. In recent years, candida is the most common etiological agent of opportunistic my-
coses. Beginning from the antibiotic era and until the present day, the morbidity associated with candidiasis has significantly increased and continues to
grow. Adverse environmental conditions which affect immune system have an important role in candidiasis as well. Candidiasis generally occurs endoge-
nously as a result of immune dysfunctions and metabolic disorders. Candidiasis can be systemic and disseminated due to massive growth spurt thus trans-
forming into fungal sepsis which affects kidneys, heart, spleen, and brain, or even into septic shock.
The paper discusses pathogenic aspects of human fungal infections, resistance, host immune responses, mixed infections, and dysbiosis. Epidemiology,
clinical signs, and diagnosis of gastrointestinal mycoses with various localization (oral/oropharyngeal, gastric, enteric) are described in details.
Key words: mycosis, сandidiasis, mixed infection, dysbiosis, immune deficiency, AIDS
