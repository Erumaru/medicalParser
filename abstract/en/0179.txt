Headaches are the most common pain syndromes in children and adolescents. In cases of primary headaches, the diagnosis is based only on the character-
istics of the clinical picture. In childhood, each diagnostic feature is essential for establishing the correct clinical diagnosis, which is clearly shown by studies
comparing the accuracy of diagnosis of the established form of headache and a probable diagnosis. In the modern international classification of headaches
(2013), special attention is paid to the diagnostic criteria of migraine in children. Diagnostic criteria for episodic syndromes equivalent to migraine in child-
hood are proposed, these syndromes are currently considered as conditions associated with migraine. The questions of the duration of the migraine attack
in children and the diagnostic criteria for such rare forms of migraine as dysfrenic migraine and Alice's in Wonderland syndrome remain discussible. In ad-
dition to traditional groups of drugs used for preventive treatment of migraine in children, nutraceuticals are used as an alternative treatment. Numerous
studies have shown the effectiveness of magnesium preparations in the prophylactic treatment of migraine in children.
Key words: migraine, children, adolescents, diagnosis, modern classification, migraine equivalents, preventive therapy, magnesium.
