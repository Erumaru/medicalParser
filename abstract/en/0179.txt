The results of recent research indicate an increase in allergic rhinitis (AR) morbidity. Rhinitis symptoms have a pronounced negative impact 
on the health-related quality of life of patients. Over the last 4 years, new international guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of AR have 
been developed, which have helped to significantly improve the management of patients with this nosology. A new concept of step-by-step AR 
therapy has been developed based on the control of clinical symptoms of the disease. Practical rhinitis control has been proposed to evaluate 
treatment outcomes and simplify disease monitoring. Following the algorithm of AR therapy depending on the severity of symptoms, 2nd gen-
eration antihistamines should be administered as a starting therapy to all patients with mild AR symptoms, as well as patients with moderate 
and severe symptoms in the absence of dominance of “stuffy nose”.
