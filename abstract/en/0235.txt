About 60% to 80% of adults experience low back pain at some point in their lifetimes. In adults, the most common cause of low back pain is 
a herniated disk. Currently, surgery is considered to be the most effective management strategy for herniated disks in the lumbar spine. To 
minimize intraoperative injury, to reduce costs, and to decrease rehabilitation period, minimally invasive surgical techniques for herniated 
disks were developed. The aim of this paper was to collect and to process findings from the studies on the efficacy and safety of minimally 
invasive surgical techniques for lumbar herniated disks in adults. It was demonstrated that endoscopic technique can compete with standard, 
more conventional techniques due to the reduced surgery time and hospital length-of-stay, small incisions, less hemorrhage and tissue injury, 
less need for opioid analgesics, and more rapid return to normal daily life. Disadvantages of endoscopic technique are long learning curve and 
high costs of the equipment and supplies.
