Musculoskeletal disorders are common in the population. Among them, osteoarthritis (OA) is of special importance. The paper summarizes data on OA oc-
currence and highlights the tendency to the increased morbidity in recent years. The factors which make difficulties for the treatment are discussed, i.e., a
myriad of pathogenic mechanisms, chronic pain, progressive destruction of the cartilage and subchondral bone, predominantly old age, comorbidities etc.
Recent ESCEO 2016 management guidelines recommend starting the treatment with symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SySADOA) early.
Data on clinical efficacy and safety of one of these SySADOAs, chondroitin sulfate, are addressed. Experimental findings uncover the mechanism of action
of chondroitin sulfate. Randomized clinical trials demonstrate clinical efficacy and high safety of this agent. Pleiotropic effect of chondroitin sulfate is dis-
cussed. The paper reviews domestic and international data on the efficacy and safety of injective chondroitin sulfate which is superior to oral chondroitin
sulfate for OA.
Key words: osteoarthritis, symptomatic slow-acting drugs, chondroitin sulfate, injective chondroitin sulfate.
