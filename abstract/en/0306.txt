Modern  treatment  methods  of  severe  forms  of  psoriasis  include  so­called  genetically  engineered  biologic  drugs  containing 
monoclonal antibodies that neutralize crucial cytokines. Most drugs for biologic therapy have a good therapeutic effect already 
after 3–6 months from the start of treatment, however, in some patients, an “effect escape” may develop, which is mainly due to 
the appearance of neutralizing antibodies to monoclonal antibodies contained in these drugs, and leads to the use of cytostatics. 
The effectiveness of the treatment of psoriasis increases significantly with the co­use of drugs and physiotherapy methods. One 
of the most active methods is an ultraviolet therapy of various spectral ranges.
Photochemotherapy (PUVA therapy) is one of the most effective modern methods of psoriasis phototherapy. Clinical recovery is 
achieved in 75–92% of cases. The article presents the successful experience of 5­year­long use of the drug Ammifurin® in almost 
twice increased doses (1.5 mg/kg). We believe that the PUVA therapy method should be applied more widely for patients with 
psoriasis in the conditions of our country, preferring it over corticosteroids, with which relapses are more common.
Key words: physiotherapy, ultraviolet therapy, genetic engineered biologic drugs, cytostatics, psoriasis, photochemotherapy,
