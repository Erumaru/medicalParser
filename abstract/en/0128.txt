Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death in the Russian Federation. β-adrenoblockers (β-AB)  are one of the main groups of cardiovas-
cular drugs with antihypertensive and anti-ischemic action and a wide evidence base. Currently, the preference is given to the selective β1-ABs with prolonged
action not only because of the simplicity of their regimen, but also due to the high safety of these drugs. The availability of the cardiovascular drugs with pro-
longed use is very important. Thus, the appearance of new generics is considered to be positive.
A review of the literature devoted to the peculiarities of the application of the first Russian generic of bisoprolol in CVD is presented. The article provides an
overview of data on generics of β-blockers available in Russia, with an analysis of clinical studies on the efficacy of various generics of bisoprolol. Arilil is a
domestic bisoprolol generic, manufactured according to GMP requirements. Along with the biological equivalence of the original drug, there is data from a
multicenter, randomized clinical trial on the complete therapeutic equivalence of Arilil to the original preparation of bisoprolol. 
Key words: cardiovascular diseases, β-adrenoblockers, bisoprolol, generiс.
