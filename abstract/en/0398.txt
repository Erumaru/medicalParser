The article gives a brief description, classification and mechanisms of action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. 
Particular attention is paid to captopril, as the most popular ACE inhibitor, its relevance in real clinical practice is considered. 
Captopril differs from other representatives of this class by the presence of an additional mechanism of antioxidant protection 
due to the content of the sulfhydryl group in the chemical structure of the preparation. Captopril promotes inhibition of lipid 
peroxidation,  which  is  mediated  by  direct  activation  of  superoxide  anion,  an  increase  in  nitric  oxide  and  a  content  inside 
magnesium  cells,  which  contributes  to  the  expressed  cardioprotective,  antiischemic  effects,  and  decreases  the  tolerance  to 
nitrates in patients with ischemic heart disease. Antihypertensive effect of the drug begins in 15â€“30 minutes, which allows to 
prescribe it for relieving the acute elevation of blood pressure. Thanks to the increase in the production of prostaglandin E2, the 
improvement of the binding of insulin to the receptors, captopril positively affects the parameters of carbohydrate metabolism, 
reducing insulin resistance. Numerous clinical studies has proved its high efficacy in patients with arterial hypertension and 
hypertensive crises, acute myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure and diabetic nephropathy.
Key words: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril, arterial hypertension, hypertensive crises, acute myocardial 
infarction, chronic heart failure, diabetic nephropathy.
