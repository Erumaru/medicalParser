Human  gastrointestinal  tract  is  colonized  by  a  complex  ecosystem  of  microorganisms.  Intestinal  bacteria  are  not  just 
commensals  —  the  gut  microbiota  constantly  undergoes  the  process  of  synbiotic  co-evolution  with  its  host.  These  bacteria 
perform numerous important functions: they produce various nutrients for the host, prevent infections caused by intestinal 
pathogens, and modulate the immunological response. The relationship between the composition of the intestinal microbiota 
and a variety of diseases (Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, obesity, type 2 diabetes, etc.) has been proved. Modifying the gut 
microbiota creates a possibility to effectively influence human health. This is the purpose for which probiotics, prebiotics and 
synbiotics are used. The following review presents modern data on their optimal composition, discusses the mechanisms of 
influence of bacteriological agents on gut microbiota and human health, and also describes the results of studies confirming 
their effectiveness.
Key  words:  gut  microbiota,  probiotics,  prebiotics,  synbiotics,  bacteriological  agents,  inflammatory  bowel  disease, 
Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, oligofructose, inulin.
