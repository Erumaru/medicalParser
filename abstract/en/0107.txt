The  article  discusses  the  treatment  of  hypertensive  crisis  at  the  prehospital  stage.  The  uncomplicated  hypertensive  crisis 
can  be  treated  on  the  out-patient  basis;  for  this  purpose  various  oral  preparations  can  be  prescribed,  taking  into  account 
contraindications to their use. The pressure should be decreased gradually, by 20-25% compared to the initial value during 2-6 
hours with the subsequent achievement of the target BP within 24-48 hours. The drug of the first choice can be captopril (for 
example, the well-known orginal preparation Kapoten), which has wide indications for use and a relatively small number of 
restrictions. In the absence of contraindications, nifedipine or moxonidine may be used as an alternative. However, nifedipine has 
a pronounced proarrhythmic effect, and therefore is not suitable for some patients. Moxonidine acts long and is characterized 
by a late onset of action, which causes a slow onset of its effect, and also increases the risk of uncontrolled hypotensive reaction 
leading to destabilization of hemodynamics, and has a number of negative side effects from the central nervous system. For 
the treatment of hypertensive crisis, a short course of beta-blocker may be prescribed to the patients with tachycardia and 
expressed vegetative manifestations. To relief the crisis against the background of heart failure and edema, furosemide may be 
used. After relief of the hypertensive crisis, it is necessary to select or adjust a constant antihypertensive therapy.
Key words: hypertension, hypertensive crisis, cardiovascular diseases, antihypertensive drugs, captopril, Kapoten, nifedipine, 
beta-blockers.
