Obesity is progressing in a number of countries around the world with a real epidemic speed. Microbiomas play an important 
role in maintaining health, immunity and metabolism. Today antibiotics are invaluable drugs used in the treatment of many 
serious infections and they continue to save countless number of lives. Side effects from antibiotic treatment on the intestinal 
microflora range from a self-limited «functional» diarrhea to a life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis. New epidemiological 
studies have shown that the use of antibiotics is associated with an increased risk of overweight and obesity. But it is not only 
antibiotic therapy that may cause the disturbance of intestinal microflora. Antibiotics are widely used as growth stimulators in 
agriculture, they are accumulated in the meat of animals and poultry that we eat. Probiotics are agents that can modulate and 
improve the intestinal microflora during antibiotic therapy. Probiotics not only prevent and treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea, 
but also contribute to weight loss and reduce overweight, they can improve immunity, prevent colds and atopic diseases, and 
also have many other effects.
Key words: obesity, antibiotics, antibiotic therapy, probiotics, Maxilac.
