Respiratory infections are the most common cause of cough in children. Due to the inflammatory process in the respiratory tract, there is a violation of mu-
cociliary clearance, accompanied by hypersecretion and a change in the rheological properties of the bronchial secretion. Drug therapy for cough should be
rational, and have multidirectional mechanisms of action with a minimum risk of developing adverse events and ultimately contribute to reducing the time of
the disease. At present, specialists have formed the newest concept of phytotherapy using the experience of traditional medicine, as well as implementing all
modern scientific achievements in pharmacy. The article examines the benefits of plant drugs on the example of Eucabal® preparations. The plant components
of the Eucabal® syrup form a thin layer and mechanically protect the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract from irritating agents that provoke a cough
reflex and thus relieve a dry irritating cough. The smell of the essential oils of Eucabal® balm C excites the breathing, deepening and increasing it, contributing
to the effectiveness of the mucolytic effect. The action of the balm can be potentiated by the simultaneous oral use of Eucabal® syrup.
Key words: pediatrics, phytotherapy, acute respiratory diseases, cough, mucociliary clearance disorders, drug plants, expectorants, Eucabal®.
