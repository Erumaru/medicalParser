Despite the relatively rare development of orofacial pain in children, this area of modern medicine is a complex pediatric problem requiring the involvement
of a multidisciplinary team of specialists, primarily a neurologist and a dentist. The subjective nature of pain makes it a difficult concept, especially in child-
hood, because newborns or young children can not express in words all the sensations experienced in pain. In the overwhelming majority of cases, orofacial
pain of the neuropathic nature is the diagnosis by exclusion. Since the cause for the development of pain in the face and oral cavity in children may be tumors
and other serious diseases, a thorough examination using a wide range of instrumental diagnostic tools is necessary. The management of this group of pa-
tients can not be limited only by the use of medicines and requires, especially in the case of chronic pain syndrome, the actions of a multidisciplinary team of
specialists involving various methods of physiotherapy, psychotherapy and physiotherapy. Therapy of orofacial pain in children, especially of neuropathic
nature, is poorly understood and requires further comprehensive development. 
Key words: orofacial pain, neuropathic pain, children.
