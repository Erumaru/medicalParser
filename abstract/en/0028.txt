The article discusses the role of bioregulatory medicine in curative and preventive programs in children. Bioregulatory medicine 
treats the body as an integrated system, where the development of any process is carried out through a multilevel interaction 
between different systems of the body, and the patient can not be cured with the help of a single substance, since it can not 
cover all the processes interrelated with the root cause and compensate for the intra-network disturbances that have appeared. 
The complex treatment and the use of multicomponent drugs can almost completely eliminate the effect of many pathogenic 
factors and achieve cure. The article gives a detailed analysis of the composition and characteristics of a complex antihomotoxic 
drug Viburkol. Its example shows the possibility of treating children with various pathological conditions (acute respiratory 
infections, teething) from the position of bioregulatory medicine. The data of international and Russian researchers on the 
possibilities of using Viburkol in pediatric practice are presented. It is shown that the complex effect of Viburkol on various 
pathological symptoms (pain, fever, restlessness, etc.) combined with good tolerability and the practicaly absence of side effects 
makes it possible to recommend it in the treatment of children.
Key words: bioregulatory medicine, homotoxicology, complex antihomotoxic drug, Viburkol, ARI, teething.
