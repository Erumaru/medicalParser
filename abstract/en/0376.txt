The practical healthcare during recent decades has been marked by the growing popularity of evidence-based medicine when 
determining methods or means of treatment and/or medical examination. At the same time, however, expenses on non-drug 
methods of treatment applied in neurology, orthopedics and rehabilitation medicine continue to increase. In recent years, there 
has been a tendency towards the growing use of osteopathy and applied kinesiology, which have slightly supplanted exercise 
therapy,  manual  therapy  and  physiotherapeutic  methods  of  treatment.  Among  the  methods  practiced  more  and  more  often 
over the last years, there is a proprietary method stemmed from applied kinesiology and osteopathy, but based on the classical 
principles of neurophysiology — the method of proprioceptive deep tendon reflex (P-DTR), elaborated by Jose Palomar. The 
following article provides the theoretical evidence underlying the method and verified by the results of the neurophysiological 
research.
Key words: clinical neurophysiology, rehabilitation, proprioceptive deep tendon reflex.
