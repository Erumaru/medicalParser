Wound infection complicates diabetes mellitus (DM) in 15–34% of patients. Standard schemes of local medical therapy of wound infection 
used in everyday practice do not provide satisfactory results in the treatment of purulonecrotic complications of DM. The emergence of new 
classes of bandages and modern interactive bandages on the pharmaceutical market requires a comprehensive assessment of the results of 
their use as means of local treatment of chronic wound infection in DM patients.
Numerous clinical studies prove the high efficacy of drugs based on ionized silver in the treatment of purulonecrotic complications of DM. The 
article presents the own experience of local therapy of puruonecrotic complications of diabetes mellitus with participation of 104 patients. It 
is shown that the therapy should be based on the complex influence on the infectious process and stimulation of regenerative and reparative 
mechanisms  in  wounds.  Optimal  results  were  obtained  in  the  group  of  patients  with  neuropathic  form  of  diabetic  foot  syndrome  using 
sulfathiazole silver (Argosulfan®).
