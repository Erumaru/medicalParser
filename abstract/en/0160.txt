The article presents a clinical case of severe dengue hemorrhagic fever, accompanied by articular syndrome, complicated by secondary 
thrombocytopenia in a 26-year-old young man who returned from a holiday in Thailand. The above clinical case is of professional 
interest for physicians of various specialties, since dengue fever is not a typical disease for residents of the Russian Federation, 
especially the Siberian region. The course of the disease was complicated by secondary thrombocytopenia and articular syndrome. 
It should be noted that the patient’s articular syndrome had a pronounced symmetric pain syndrome, swelling and stiffness for 15 
minutes in the morning, against the background of a pronounced intoxication syndrome, however, an ultrasound examination of the 
joints did not reveal any pathology. The absence of any pathognomonic symptoms of the disease in the initial period creates difficulties 
in the diagnosis of dengue fever. Timely laboratory diagnosis, based on identifying immunoglobulins of classes M and G to the dengue 
virus, not only helps to make a differential diagnosis with other hemorrhagic fevers, but also to save the patient’s life. Clinicians and 
physicians of hospitals should be wary of patients with febrile syndrome and pay more attention to the epidemiological history.
Key words: dengue fever, tourists, Southeast Asia, thrombocytopenia, clinic, complication, diagnosis, treatment.
