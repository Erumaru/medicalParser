Back pain is the most common complaint in patients who visit neurologist or general practitioner. Dorsalgia significantly limits daily activity and reduces
quality of life. Therefore, most patients appeal for medical help to reduce pain. Moreover, pain reduction is one of the key criteria of treatment efficacy. The
understanding of pain causes and mechanisms determines treatment success while being the basis of customized therapeutic regimens. As a rule, back pain
is non-specific as a result of muscular and ligamentous dysfunctions or degenerative dystrophic damage of the spinal column. The paper addresses etiolog-
ical factors and diagnostic aspects of back pain. Principles of dorsalgia treatment considering the type and duration of the pain as well as comorbidities are
highlighted. Cardiovascular and gastroenterological disorders and diabetes occurred in most patients with back pain. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) are commonly used for acute and chronic back pain. Therefore, rational prescription of NSAIDs considering comorbidities is an important issue.
Complex treatment of non-specific back pain should include NSAIDs and B vitamins. Artrozan/meloxicam and Combilipen Tabs, domestic agents, are an avail-
able, effective, and safe treatment.
Key words: back pain, comorbidity, NSAIDs, meloxicam, Artrozan, B vitamins, Combilipen Tabs.
