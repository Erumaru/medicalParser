Aim. To analyze the efficacy and safety of biologics for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in real-world clinical settings (by patient registry databases).
Materials and methods. Systematic review in the literature through the PubMed database. 17 original papers which include data on the safety of biological
therapy/survival rate from 9 registries of patients with psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis.
Results. According to PSOLAR registry, the rate of serious infectious complications (per 100 patient-years) was 2.49 for infliximab, 1.97 for adalimumab,
1.47 for etanercept, and 0.83 for ustekinumab. According to PsoBest, the rate of infections (per 100 patient-years) was 1.3 for infliximab, 0.52 for adali-
mumab, 1.0 for etanercept, and 0.5 for ustekinumab. The rate of cardiovascular events (per 100 patient-years) was for 0.2 etanercept and 0.25 for ustek-
inumab. . Malignancy rate (per 100 patient-years) was 0 for infliximab, 0.5 for adalimumab, 0.2 for etanercept, and 0.7 for ustekinumab. According to Bio-
Capture registry, the rate of infectious and cardiovascular complications (per 100 patient-years) for etanercept was 0.93 and 2.18, respectively, while ma-
lignancy rate (per 100 patient-years) for etanercept and adalimumab was 2.81 and 1.8, respectively. According to BADBIR, the rate of infectious complica-
tions (per 100 patient-years) was 2.6 for infliximab, 1.02 for adalimumab, 0.1 for etanercept, and 1.1 for ustekinumab. The rate of cardiovascular events
(per 100 patient-years) for adalimumab was 0.12. Malignancy rate (per 100 patient-years) was 0.16 for adalimumab, 0.2 for etanercept, and 0.18 for ustek-
inumab. According to Biobadaderm registry, tuberculosis rate (per 100 patient-years) was 0.6 for infliximab and 0.27 for adalimumab. Infliximab (Dermbio)
or ustekinumab (BADBIR) demonstrated the highest survival rate.
Conclusions. Patient registries provide valuable information on the safety profile and other aspects of biological therapy in a real-world clinical settings.
However, the comparability of the data from different registries is limited due to their heterogeneity. Comprehensive analysis of all available data should be
performed to assess the safety profile of biologic preparations.
Key words: psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, patient registries, biologics, safety, adverse events.
