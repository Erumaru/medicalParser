Meta-analysis of the use of acetyl-L-carnitine with diabetic peripheral neuropathy

The role of deficiency of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) and L-carnitine (LC) in the development of peripheral diabetic neuropathy is discussed in the literature, but
there is little clinical evidence for this.
The meta-analysis includes six articles, with the total number of 711 diabetic patients. Three RCTs (340 patients were treated with ALC vs. 203 placebo and
115 patients received methylcobalamine) showed that ALC reduces pain perception (SMD = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.86 to 0.04; P = 0.03; I 2 = 85%). Compared to
control, the addition of ALC increased both nerve conduction velocity and amplitude response for ulnar nerve (both sensory and motor component). Compared
to baseline values, the addition of ALC/LC improved the nerve conduction velocity for all the sensory and motor nerves (except ulnar and peroneal) and the
response amplitude for each of the nerves. Adverse events were usually limited to minimal side effects.
It has been proved that ALC reduces the pain caused by diabetic polyneuropathy, compared with active and placebo-controls, and improves electromyographic
parameters in these patients.
