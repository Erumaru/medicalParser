At present, there are many diseases in which proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used. This article shows the history of the use of the drugs blocking acid prod-
ucts, with a description of the mechanisms of action. The article also presents the basic principles of using PPIs and the connection between the administra-
tion of these drugs and class-specific side effects (B12 and iron deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, calcium and magnesium malabsorption, the risk of develop-
ing clostridial infection, increased risk of cardiovascular pathology in PPI and clopidogrel polypharmacy). The data of retrospective studies on the effect of
proton pump inhibitors on the risk of ischemic stroke are given. These studies showed a correlation between the use of PPIs (most pronounced in omeprazole,
pantoprozole, lansoprozole, esomeprosol and not established in rabeprozole) and the risk of developing ischemic stroke. The authors show a dose-dependent
effect that causes the development of ischemic stroke (the higher the dose, the higher the risk). Thus authors recommend to continue studying the mechanisms
of development of this correlation and its reliability. 
Key words: proton pump inhibitors, class-specific side effects, PPIs stroke, omeprazole, pantoprozole, lansoprozole, esomeprosol, rabeprozole.
