The problem of population aging and widespread prevalence of comorbidity with the presence of chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) 
requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving physicians, general practitioners and neurologists. CCI is one of the most common 
diseases leading to a serious decrease in the quality of life and severe disability of older patients. The article presents data on the 
etiology, diagnostic possibilities and basic principles of CCI therapy. Treatment of CCI, accompanied by cognitive disorders, includes 
the treatment of the underlying disease, non-drug therapy and the use of neuroprotective drugs. Among the drugs with neuroprotective 
properties, Actovegin is a unique preparation of biological origin that can provide multiple effects on both microcirculation and cellular 
metabolic processes and the regulation of neuronal apoptosis, and ultimately improve the cognitive function of patients with cerebral 
vascular diseases. This drug has an extensive evidence base in both experimental and clinical trials. Due to its low influence on blood 
pressure and a high safety profile, Actovegin can be recommended for a wide use in the therapy of patients with CCI.
Key words: chronic cerebral ischemia, dyscirculatory encephalopathy, dementia, cognitive disorders, neuroprotective drugs, 
Actovegin.
