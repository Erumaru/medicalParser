The article is devoted to the therapy of cough which is one of the frequent reasons for seeking medical help. The authors show the causes and mechanism of
coughing. Underestimation of the cough nature due to its misinterpretation often leads to a late start of rational therapy and increases the risk of develop-
ing bacterial complications. Features of the mechanisms for the formation of various options for coughing provide an optimal choice of adequate therapy. The
algorithm of rational antitussive therapy includes several stages. At the initial stage, it is needed to carefully collect the history for a more accurate assess-
ment of the nature of the cough (productivity, intensity, time and duration of its occurrence during the day, impact on quality of life) and determine the cause
of its occurrence. At the second stage for the correct diagnosis it is necessary to analyze the results of the conducted physical and laboratory-instrumental
methods of studies. The final stage is the differential selection of antitussive drugs, taking into account their pharmacological characteristics. The article ex-
amines in detail the groups of drugs that affect cough, taking into account their mechanism of action. Particular attention is paid to the multicomponent phy-
topreparation (Eucabal®) with a wide range of therapeutic effects, the effectiveness and safety of which have been proven in clinical studies.
Key words: cough, causes, mechanism, cough treatment, phytotherapy, Eucabal®.
