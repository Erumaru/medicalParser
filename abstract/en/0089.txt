Doctors  of  various  specializations  examine  the  patients  with  a  burdened  pharmacological  history.  The  treatment  of  such 
patients  requires  an  individual  approach,  taking  into  account  the  drug  hypersensitivity.  Such  patients  should  be  examined 
by allergist-immunologist to identify the offending drugs and select the alternative medications. Doctors of other specialties 
suggest that there are tests in vitro, which can be used by the allergist for accurate identification of the offending drug. But 
this is an erroneous opinion. Unfortunately, today there is no completely reliable method for diagnosis of drug allergy. This 
is due to heterogenous mechanisms of drug hypersensitivity, a wide range of medicines, a reaction on metabolites, individual 
features. The article describes a set of diagnostic methods, used for testing the drug hypersensitivity. The authors emphasize 
that in vivo testing is associated with certain risks of adverse reactions, and in vitro tests are safe, but unfortunately, they are 
not informative, which complicates the examination of patients with drug allergy.
Key words: drug allergy, drug hypersensitivity, diagnosis, in vitro tests, in vivo tests, skin testing, graded challenge test.
