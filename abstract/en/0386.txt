Bladder cancer is one of the most common tumors in the structure of cancer incidence. For a long time, due to poor understanding of 
the correlations between its molecular and clinical features, there has been little success in treatment of this pathology. The data ob-
tained showed that bladder cancer includes a group of molecular-heterogeneous subtypes, which, in the course of various treatment 
options,  possessed  diverse  therapeutic  responses.  Recently,  due  to  the  close  connection  between  the  molecular  subtypes  of  bladder 
cancer and clinical and pathological features, specific therapeutic strategies have been proposed. This review summarizes the current 
understanding of the molecular pathology of bladder cancer, including its molecular biomarkers and molecular subtypes, which have 
been successfully identified using high technology. Progress in understanding the personalization of treatment of specific molecular 
subtypes is also discussed.
