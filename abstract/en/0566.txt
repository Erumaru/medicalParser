Currently, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the major issues in gastroenterology. Despite various treatment and preventive approaches, the
number of patients with refractory GERD continues to grow. Potential pathogenic mechanisms of this disease (which are well-known and well-characterized)
determine therapeutic strategies for GERD. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are considered as the gold standard GERD treatment. The drugs for GERD should
be both effective and safe and provide long-term remission. Enantiomers of PPIs with improved pharmacokinetic profile meet these requirements. Recently,
dexlansoprazole, the dextrorotatory isomer of lansoprazole with dual release and long-term antisecretory effect, was approved in Russia. The paper discusses
the causes of refractory GERD and algorithms of its treatment using prokinetic agents, antacids, and immediate-release PPIs.
Key words: GERD, refractory, efficacy of therapy, PPIs, Dexilant.
