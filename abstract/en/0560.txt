Prostate cancer is the most common form of malignant neoplasms in men. Despite significant success in the treatment of patients in advanced stages of the
disease, problems remain with regard to the optimal treatment of both hormone sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer. In a recent study, in 23%
of cases with metastatic prostate cancer, latent aberrations in BRCA1 / 2 and ATM were identified, which are known to be key genes in DNA repair, and in
8% of the patients, congenital mutations in these genes were detected. The use of poly (ADP-ribose) -polymerase inhibitors in the treatment of patients with
prostate cancer is considered. Particular attention is paid to such drugs as olaparib and velparib. It is noted that the appearance of drugs of this class, of
course, has a great prospect in use and inspires certain hopes for the optimization of therapeutic measures. Inhibition of PARP is one of the most promising
approaches to "precise therapy". Over the next few years, through ongoing clinical research, we need to have a better understanding of whether our expec-
tations will be actually translated into clinical reality. Among the many promising drugs, there will undoubtedly be those that do not justify the current
hopes.
