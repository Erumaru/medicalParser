The most common and problematic manifestation of allergic rhinitis is the rhinedema, which blocks nasal breathing. Often, 
allergic rhinitis is not diagnosed or the diagnosis is established with a great delay, which, in turn, leads to inadequate therapy 
and, as a result, inefficiency of treatment. Otorhinolaryngologist focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of allergic rhinitis, 
but in the atopic march in most of cases the development of allergic rhinitis is preceded by urticaria. The article gives special 
consideration to the treatment of this allergopathology, which includes the elimination of the active allergen and rational drug 
treatment. In particular, the authors present the data concerning the effectiveness of the use of H1-histamine receptor blockers 
of the second generation for treating the patients with allergic rhinitis of varying severity. The article gives a review of the use of 
the antihistamine preparation of II generation - ebastine (Espa-Bastine®), which should be actively included in the recommended 
treatment regimens of allergic rhinitis and urticaria, which showed high efficacy and safety in the therapy of these diseases.
Key words: allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion, treatment, antihistamines, H1-histaminoblockers, ebastine.
