The article presents the structure of divergence of clinical diagnoses in patients with disseminate lung lesions (DLL). Authors described an advanced tech-
nology of transbronchial lung biopsy (TBB) based on chest 3D modeling that isolates pathological elements, calculates the volume of affected lung tissue in
patients with DLL and develops navigation maps that increases the effectiveness of  sampling biopsy material during TBB.
Objective: To estimate the role of improved TBB in DLL diagnosis.
Material and Methods: In group 1 (n = 459) examination results and the structure of divergence of clinical diagnoses in patients with DLL were retrospec-
tively analyzed. Informational content of biopsy specimens of lung tissue obtained during TBB with 3D-navigation (group 2) and traditional TBB (group 2)
were compared in 50 patients with DLL. Results: The analysis of  patients with DPL (n = 459) revealed a significant (p <0,05) divergence of clinical diag-
noses, reaching 48%. The chance of receiving informative material in group 2 – 1.125, in group 3 -  0.143 (p<0.05, standard error of OR 0.83, OR 7.875 (95%
CI:1.547; 40.092), RR 1,688 (95% CI:1.171; 2.431) Standard error of relative risk (S) 0.186. 
Conclusion: Usage of individual virtual 3D navigation map, based on chest CT, allows to obtain informative biopsy specimens during TBB 1.69 times more likely
than traditional TBB, which leads to reduction of length of stay, diagnostic load for a patient and decreases expenses of the hospital for DLL management.
