Allergic  diseases  are  a  global  epidemiological  problem:  10–30%  of  the  planet  population  has  any  allergic  diseases’  manifestations. 
In this regard, early diagnosis and prevention of allergic diseases are extremely relevant. Current allergy diagnosis is a wide range 
of effective tools that allow maximally personalizing the diagnosis and predicting treatment effectiveness. Mainly, IgE are involved 
in allergic reactions development, as they are responsible for the manifestation of immediate-type allergy and are detected by using 
various diagnostic tools.
Polysensitization is an important clinical characteristic, as it affects about 70–80% of the world’s allergic population. The diagnostic pathway 
requires an adequate and detailed methodology based on the compliance demonstration of medical history with documented sensitization. 
The patient management with polysensitization should rely on a careful examination, mainly, based on the possibilities of allergy molecular 
diagnostics. Multiplex systems are the most breakthrough method, which gives a complete sensitization profile picture (a key aspect of the 
allergic diseases’ diagnosis).
Keywords: allergic diseases, IgE, allergy diagnosis, polysensitization, biochip, component diagnosis, molecular diagnostics, ACIT.
