Osteoarthrosis (OA) is a heterogeneous group of disorders of various etiology which involve articular cartilage as well as subchondral bone, ligaments, joint
capsule, synovia, and periarticular muscles. Gonarthrosis is one of the most important and disabling types of OA. Pain is most common clinical manifestation
of OA and an independent predictor of disease progression. Pain in OA is associated with a variety of factors, i.e., synovitis and effusion, vitamin D deficiency,
muscle weakness, obesity, female sex, physical activity, psychological factors, congenital joint abnormalities, joint deformations (by MRI or X-ray), and in-
crease in cytokine and inflammatory marker levels. The analysis of these factors determines a set of therapeutic and preventive measures in these patients.
It is well-known that analgesia is a primary treatment goal in OA of any localization. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remain the gold stan-
dard for pain. Lornoxicam/Xefocam is the member of oxicam class. Clinical trials of lornoxicam for pain relief in OA demonstrate that its efficacy is similar
to that of other NSAIDs. This agent can be prescribed to reduce both acute and chronic pains.
Key words: osteoarthrosis, gonarthrosis, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, congenital joint abnormalities, X-ray signs, NSAID, lornoxicam, Xefocam, Xefocam
