Acute bronchitis (AB) is an inflammatory disease of bronchial tubes, mainly of infectious origin, manifesting with cough (dry or productive) and continuing
up to 3 weeks. Prevalence of AB in population is extremely high: every year 5% of adult population get sick. Acute cough is one of the most frequent causes
of visits to therapist. Although it is routine patients the doctor faces a lot of difficulties despite the banality of diagnosis. So, AB becomes almost the main cause
of unjustified antibiotic use, often masks diseases such as bronchial asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
pneumonia. The paper addresses etiology, diagnosis, differential diagnosis and therapy, presents clinical case of a patient with suspected AB with focus on
medical history, objective, laboratory and instrumental methods of examination. The article focuses on etiotropic (antibacterial), antitussive, bronchodila-
tor, mucoactive therapy. The most effective antitussive agents with efferent peripheral action are mucolytics. They liquefy bronchial secretion well due to
changes in mucus structure. Acetylcysteine is widely used in clinical practice. Basic mechanisms of acetylcysteine action are discussed, as well as indications
and experience of clinical use for AB treatment .
Key words: acute bronchitis, bronchial inflammatory diseases, acetylcysteine, clinical case report, mucolytics, mucoactive drugs.
