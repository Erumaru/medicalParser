Decongestants are the most common non-prescription drugs, which are widely used not only for the treatment of acute colds, but also for other acute and
chronic diseases of ENT organs.
A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of nasal decongestants in the form of dosage sprays Oxifrin and Nazivin
sensitiv.
Patients and methods. The study included 30 patients with chronic pathology of the nose and paranasal sinuses, who permanently used nasal decongestants
for a long time. Each patient consequently used Nazivin sensitive and Oxifrin dosage sprays (each for 1 week) for 2 weeks instead of his usual vasoconstric-
tive drug. The effectiveness and comfort of the use of drugs was assessed both objectively - by the active anterior rhinomanometry method (in the first 10 pa-
tients), and subjectively - by questionnaire.
Results. Objective measurements of the vasoconstrictor effect with active anterior rhinomanometry did not reveal significant differences between Nazivin and
Oxifrin. The total inspiratory flow was 536.0 ± 181.9 and 520 ± 225.2 ml / s, respectively (p = 0.67). The strength of Nazivin and Oxyfrin was evaluated by
patients on a 10-point scale on average at 8 and 7.5 points, respectively (p = 0.388).
Conclusion. Dosage nasal vasoconstrictive spray Oxifrin is comparable in its effectiveness and comfort with the original drug Nazivin sensitive.
