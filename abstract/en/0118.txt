In the last decades, a myriad of comprehensive clinical studies on vitamin D effects were performed worldwide. Many of these studies illustrate the role of
vitamin D in reducing the risk of various disorders. Population epidemiological studies demonstrated high rate of vitamin D deficiency in various age groups
of certain countries. Early diagnosis and treatment of vitamin D deficiency may reduce the risk of many disorders. At present, we are familiar with the phys-
iology, metabolism, and bone effects of vitamin D as well as its impact on human organs and systems. According to several authors, vitamin D affects age-
ing, tumorigenesis, atherosclerosis, immune responses, and gene expression.
The paper summarizes the results of clinical studies on vitamin D levels in the population and the influence of obesity on vitamin D levels. Pathogenic role of
vitamin D deficiency in cardiovascular and carbohydrate metabolism disorders is illustrated. The results of summarized clinical studies give an idea of pro-
tective role of vitamin D in various conditions.
