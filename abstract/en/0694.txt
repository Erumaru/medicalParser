Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death in most countries of the world, they lead to an increase in the 
disability  of  the  adult  population,  which  is  accompanied  by  an  increase  in  economic  costs.  It  is  not  accidental  that  CVD  is 
nowadays called the «epidemic of the XXI century». According to epidemiological data in the Russian Federation — coronary 
heart disease (СHD) is one of the main causes of death and disability of patients. The prevalence of СHD in our country is 
13.5%, in the US — almost 2 times lower — 7%. It is expected that by 2030 from СHD and stroke, about 23.6 million people will 
die. According to forecasts, these diseases will remain the main individual causes of death. Understanding the causes of the 
development of these diseases, as well as expanding opportunities in their prevention, diagnosis and treatment is one of the 
key priorities of today’s cardiology. To a patient with СHD, the clinician should prescribe pathogenetic therapy not only for the 
purpose of correcting the quality of life, but also for improving the prognosis and reducing the risk of cardiovascular mortality. 
The article fully presents the role of acetylsalicylic acid in secondary prevention of CVD, in particular СHD and myocardial 
infarction.
Key words: cardiovascular diseases, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, acetylsalicylic acid, secondary prevention.
