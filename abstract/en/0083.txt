Polyneuropathy is a frequent complication of diabetes mellitus, associated with severe disability, a decrease in the quality of the patients’ life, and an in-
creased risk of death. Treatment of patients with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPNP) includes correction of carbohydrate metabolism, restoration of the structure
and functions of nerve fibers, elimination of the most significant symptoms of the disease. At present, there are data on the efficacy of the use of acetyl-L-
carnitine (Carnicetine) in such patients. Information on its role in metabolism in normal and pathological conditions is considered. The effects of carnitine in
patients with various types of DPNP are discussed in detail. The results of randomized clinical trials and meta-analysis on this issue are presented, indicating
the effectiveness of the drug in patients with DPNP. The obtained data give grounds to consider Carnicetine as a drug, the use of which is justified in patients
with DPNP as a means of pathogenetic and symptomatic therapy.
Key words: diabetes mellitus, diabetic polyneuropathy, acetyl-L-carnitine, Carnicetine, treatment.
