Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by a papulosquamous eruption. Effective and safe topical 
preparations development for mild to moderate psoriasis remains a critical problem. Bacteriorhodopsin, a retinal containing chromoprotein, 
recently appeared in the cosmetic market and can be used by patients with psoriasis.
Aim: to evaluate efficacy and tolerance of day and night cream with bacteriorhodopsin in patients with psoriasis.
Patients and Methods: the study enrolled 30 patients (19 men and 11 women), aged 18 to 79 years (average age was 43.9±11.5), with 
mild (27/30) and moderate (3/30) severity vulgar psoriasis. Medication effectiveness study was carried out using confocal laser scanning 
microscopy in vivo on the 0th and 2nd week, PASI indices determination was carried out on the 0th, 2nd, 4th week, dermatology specific 
quality of life (DSQL) — on the 0th, 4th week.
Results:  4  weeks  after  beginning  the  cream  treatment  course,  there  was  a  significant  PASI  reduction  (average  score  6.3±2.6  in  week  0 
compared to 2.0±1.6 in week 4) (p<0.05). There was a significant improvement in the patient’s life quality: average DSQL in week 0 was 
11.9±3.21 compared to 3.9±2.0 in week 4 (p<0.05). In week 4, 86,6% of patients (26/30) achieved clinical improvement with PASI decrease 
more than 50% (p<0.05). Nine patients achieved a 50% PASI decrease, eight — 75%, five — 90%, four — 100%.
Conclusion: creams with bacteriorhodopsin contribute to the rapid elimination of disease clinical manifestations and improve life quality, 
which is confirmed by the results of the confocal microscopy and the PASI and DSQL average indices decrease to 68% and 67% respectively.
