Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most common drugs in clinical practice. At the same time, along with the high pharmacotherapeu-
tic efficacy according to the main indications, a wide range of complications is associated with the intake of NSAIDs. It is especially important that NSAIDs
have a negative specific effect on the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, manifested by mild dyspepsia or the development of erosions, peptic ulcers, bleed-
ing. The published practical recommendations are aimed at reducing the risk of developing gastrointestinal disorders when using NSAIDs and allow clinicians
to make an informed decision regarding the choice of the drug, the need for prevention and the principles of treatment of NSAIDs in a particular clinical case.
Along with the appointment of selective NSAIDs with the least number of adverse events for the prevention and treatment of gastropathies, the use of proton
pump inhibitors (PPI) is indicated. Pantoprazole (the original drug Controlock) has not only clinical efficacy, but also minimal drug interactions. This fact
allows us to consider pantoprazole as the safest PPI, and gives it an advantage in cases where it is necessary to prescribe several drugs with a similar way
of metabolism in the liver, while being sure that there is no risk of developing symptoms of an overdose or reducing the effect of these drugs.
Key words: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), NSAIDs-gastropathies, proton pump inhibitors, pantoprazole, Controlock
