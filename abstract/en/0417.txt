Insomnia is a sleep disorder that occurs both independently and on a background of psychological and physiological distress. It leads to decreased quality
of life and  worsening of comorbidities course. Despite the fact that today the principles of its diagnostics and treatment are simple enough, doctors of gen-
eral practice face some tactical issues of treatment, caused primarily by psychological state of the patient, limited choice of sleeping pills, that are often far
from ideal hypnotic. The paper addresses some diagnostic (assessment of levels of anxiety, depression, dysfunctional beliefs, polysomnography) and thera-
peutic techniques (principles of sleep hygiene, method of cognitive-behavioral therapy, phytotherapy and other drugs), which can help doctors to select tac-
tics and strategies for insomnia treatment faster, particularly with concomitant somatic and neurological disorders. Attention is paid to peculiarities of iden-
tifying hidden sleep disorders, mechanism of action of modern sleeping pills. Timely diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders (non-drug approaches are
extremely effective) have a positive effect on the underlying disease course.
Key words: insomnia, insomnia treatment, sleep quality, sleep hygiene.
