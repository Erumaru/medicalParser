The paper analyzes recent published data and author’s clinical and empirical findings to uncover the pathogenesis of pain syndrome in chronic prostatitis
and potential modalities for its pharmacotherapy. Pains in chronic prostatitis are similar in terms of clinical manifestations, however, their causative and
pathogenic mechanisms are different and often combine in the same patient. Therefore, chronic prostatitis is a multifactorial and interdisciplinary disorder.
Considering this, differential and personalized approach to identify the origin of pains in chronic prostatitis as well as personalized pharmacotherapy choice
to reduce pains are required. The paper highlights etiology, pathogenesis, and medical treatment of non-infectious (venous congestion and neuropathic) pains
in chronic prostatitis. Recent data demonstrate that beta-escin and alpha-lipoic acid are an effective treatment for chronic prostatitis.
Key words: chronic prostatitis, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, prostatic pains, β-escin, α-lipoic acid, pharmacotherapy.
