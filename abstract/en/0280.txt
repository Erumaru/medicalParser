Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a polyetiological metabolic disease accompanied by systemic damage to organs, including the central nervous 
system. Clinically, these changes are associated with cognitive impairment, the pathogenesis of which is also largely heterogeneous.
Aim: to assess the tau protein role in the cognitive impairment diagnosis in patients with type 1 and type 2 DM.
Patients  and  Methods:  the  study  was  approved  by  the  Ethics  Committee.  All  patients  signed  informed  consent.  The  study  design  was 
observational, cross­sectional and snapshot. It included 63 patients with type 1 DM, whose average age was 29.1±8.5 years, and the control 
group of 25 subjects matched for sex and age. In addition, 102 patients with type 2 DM at the age of 60.8±11.9 years were also recruited, 
whereas the control group consisted of 20 subjects matched by sex and age. Patients underwent the evaluation for blood glucose, glycated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c), and tau protein levels. Cognitive functions were tested using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). To assess 
glucose variability, glycemia continuous monitoring was performed with coefficients estimated.
Results: patients with type 1 and type 2 DM had cognitive impairment (25.5 (24–27) and 21.3 (19–24)) points, according to MoCA test. The 
impairment clinical spectrum varied depending on the DM type. When assessing the tau protein level, a significant increase in its content 
was registered among patients with type 1 and type 2 DM (p=0.001, U=113.0; p=0.001; U=11.0). Correlation analysis showed a moderate 
positive  association  of  tau  protein  level  with  fasting  glycemia  levels  (r=0.6,  p<0.001),  glycated  hemoglobin  (r=0.5,  p<0.001),  and  high 
positive association — with MoCA test (r=0.9, p<0.001). Adding that, in the group with type 2 DM, a weakly positive association was found 
between the tau protein level and the presence of cognitive impairments (r=0.2, p<0.001), and strong positive association — with the age of 
patients (r=0.8, p<0.001). Significant associations in coefficients of variation and associations with tau protein level were found only in the 
group with type 1 DM.
Conclusion: in DM, cognitive impairments development is associated with tauopathy and chronic hyperglycemia.
