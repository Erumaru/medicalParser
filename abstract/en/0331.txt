Psoriasis is a common chronic relapsing inflammatory cutaneous disease; the main role in the inflammation of this conditionis played by lymphocyte Th1,
Th17 and their cytokines. The activity of these cells is modulated by a particularkind of T cells recently described: the T regulatory cells  (Treg). These are able
to inhibit the immunological response and to maintain the cutaneous immunological homeostasis, thus preventing autoimmunity against self antigens. Few
data are available in the literature as to Treg in psoriasis; several studies demonstrate that the function of these cells is impaired in this condition and treat-
ments for psoriasis may increase the number and activity of Treg. The role of these cells in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is very important to understand how
they may contribute to the development of this cutaneous disorder. In the near future it would be possible to target therapies at these defects, improving the
activity of these cells and maintaining cutaneous homeostasis, preventing psoriasis or other inflammatory cutaneous conditions.
Key words: regulatory T cells, psoriasis, innate immunity.
