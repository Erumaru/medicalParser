The lecture is devoted to the issues of changes occurring in the reproductive system of men with the age. It has been shown that low testosterone syndrome
in middle-aged and older men occurs in a very small percentage of cases and according to the data of modern reproductive endocrinology, the mechanisms
of menopause development in women and hypogonadism in adult men are incommensurable phenomena. Key indicators of the reproductive system of men
in different age periods (level of testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, gonadotropins and spermatogenesis) are highlighted. The consequences of an
age-related decrease in testosterone secretion and the possibility of its elimination / prevention by testosterone drugs are presented. The author considers
the influence of testosterone preparations on sexual function, bone mineral density, muscle and fat tissue, the severity of anemia and erythrocytosis, de-
pression, cognitive function and on metabolic and cardiovascular parameters. Indications for the treatment with testosterone in older men are given. It is
shown that the treatment regimens and testosterone preparations are the same as for hypogonadism of any other nature. In this case, on the background of
treatment the target value of testosterone in the blood serum should be less than in young patients in order to minimize side effects.
Key words: male reproductive system, hypogonadism, testosterone, spermatogenesis, testosterone preparations.
