Diagnostic and treatment strategy for joint disorders in general practice
Prof. Yves Henrotin (University of Liège, Belgium), Prof. Lyudmila I. Alexeeva (Institute of Rheumatology, Moscow, Russia).

Two reports were presented at the conference "The strategy of diagnosis and treatment of joint disorders in general practice". Prof. Yves Henrotin highlight-
ed that osteoarthrosis is not only aging-associated disease which involves articular cartilage but metabolic disease as well which affects nearby tissues and
results in a number of comorbidities. The major cause of osteoarthrosis is inflammation. Prof. Henrotin summarized the results of clinical trials of Piascle-
dine 300 which has an effect on articular tissues both in vitro and in vivo.
Prof. Lyudmila I. Alexeeva discussed recent recommendations for the management of knee osteoarthrosis in the real clinical practice. The algorithm which
was developed by clinicians and scientists from several countries consistently reflects basic principles of osteoarthrosis treatment and considers efficacy and
safety of the treatment as well. Prof. Alexeeva argued for an individual treatment approach which takes into account comorbidities and multiple morbidity.
