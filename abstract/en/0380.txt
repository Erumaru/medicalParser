Aim: to study recanalization of deep veins in patients with proximal thrombosis against the background of prolonged antiplatelet therapy 
(APT) with warfarin, dabigatran etexilate and sulodexide during the year.
Patients and Methods: 210 patients were included in the study. Group 1 includes 68 patients treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKA). 
Group 2 consisted of 78 patients who were prescribed dabigatran etexilate after standard heparin therapy for 5 days. Group 3 consisted of 
64 patients, who were prescribed sulodexide after 3 months after the course of standard ACT (heparin in the acute period with transition to 
VKA). US-angioscanning of the lower limbs venous system was performed at the hospitalization of the patient and on the eve of discharge for  
10–14 days against the background of APT by standard common methods. Later on, outpatients underwent a study of vein recanalization on 
Envisor C and Acuson Antares scanners (Germany) during a year after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months from the beginning of randomization.
Results: the frequency of patients with occlusion forms in the proximal segment against the background of prolonged therapy with warfarin 
during the year is statistically significantly higher by 20.7% and 18.3%, respectively, than on dabigatran etexilate and sulodexide. At the same 
time, no cases of residual thrombotic occlusions of the main veins were detected in patients taking dabigatran etexilate during the year, and 
only in 2.4% of patients taking dabigatran etexilate.
Conclusion: prolonged use of dabigatran etexilate and sulodexide for a year in patients with deep vein proximal thrombosis exceeds warfarin 
safety and is accompanied by the development of early recanalization in the proximal segments of the venous channel.
