Approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of facial pains, significantly differ from each other depending on the profile of the doctor. The most frequent
causes of the orofascial pains are diseases of the dento-facial system. Most patients apply to dentists who usually cope with this problem successfully, but in
a number of cases the pain has a different nature. The most common cause of facial pains not associated with dental diseases is a temporomandibular joint
disorder (TMJD), the development of which is mainly caused by two interrelated processes: the pathology of the joint itself (especially the displacement of
the disc) and the pathology of the masticatory muscles surrounding the joint. Significant role in these processes is played by psychogenic factors. A wide
range of therapeutic measures is used for the treatment of TMJD, the most important of them are early diagnosis, explanation of the benign nature of the dis-
ease, the use of NSAIDs, physiotherapy procedures, the use of the kappa, in the case of inefficiency, minimally invasive interventions are possible. In connec-
tion with the multifactorial nature of chronic orofacial pain, approaches to the prevention and treatment of this condition should be based on a biopsychosocial
model of the pain development.
