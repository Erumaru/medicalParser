The review presents a modern view of the risk factors for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), compliance to antisecretory therapy and ways to increase it,
the diagnosis and treatment of extra-esophageal manifestations of GERD, and the risks associated with long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).
Risk factors for GERD are lowering the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter, increasing the number of transient relaxations of the lower esophageal
sphincter, eating certain products and taking medications, increasing the body mass index. The contribution of Helicobacter pylori infection to the patho-
genesis of GERD and Barrett's esophagus is controversial.
One of the reasons for the treatment failure in patients with GERD is a low treatment compliance. This problem can be solved by the appointment of PPIs with
double delayed release, which can be used regardless of mealtime.
A great difficulty for clinicians are extra-esophageal manifestations of GERD - bronchial asthma, cough and laryngopharyngeal reflux. Such patients need
a long-term therapy with PPIs, whose safety (increased risk of infection, reduced bone mineral density, hypomagnesemia) is an open question for discussion.
Key words: GERD, proton pump inhibitors, therapy compliance, extra-esophageal manifestations of GERD.
