Vertigo is one of the most common symptoms with which patients come to the doctor, and almost a third of people over the age of 60 face with this problem.
Vertigo significantly affects the everyday life of a large number of patients. In elderly patients, vertigo may lead to falls, which are the main cause of a sud-
den death in patients older than 65 years. The article describes the types of vertigo and their main causes. However, the cause of vertigo often stays unknown.
The drug Vertigohel® is an effective and safe medicine for treating vertigo of various origins, that is proved by many scientific studies, including randomized
clinical trials, non-interventional studies of daily patient care, and a meta-analysis of clinical trials. The therapeutic equivalence of Vertigohel® is established
in clinical trials in comparison with other currently used drugs. Vertigohel® is an excellent choice for vertigo treatment, which can be taken prior to exami-
nation by a specialist.
Key words: vestibular vertigo, non- vestibular vertigo, efficiency, microcirculation, Vertigohel®.
