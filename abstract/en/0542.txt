Cervicogenic headache (CH) is one of the most common forms of secondary cephalalgia. From the point of view of neurobiology, CH is the most well-studied
headache. The functional connection of the neurons of the posterior horns C1-3 with the caudal nucleus of the V pair forms the basis for the trigeminocervical
complex (TCС) and the development of CH. Despite this, the clinical diagnosis of CH, the differential diagnosis between CH and cervicogenic component in
primary forms of headaches (migraine, tension headache), the definition of effective treatment is very difficult. The article considers the issues of clinical
features, differential diagnostics of CH, evidence-based approaches to the drug and non-drug therapy, the role of local anesthesia. Diagnosis and treatment
of the CH is a complex, multidisciplinary task, associated with certain complexities and requiring an active combination of local anesthesia, manual therapy,
curative gymnastics and, if necessary, pharmacotherapy. Literature data on the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are given, among which
ibuprofen (for example, in the product Nurofen®), analgesics and other groups of drugs are most effective.
Key words: cervicogenic headache, neck pain, migraine, tension headache, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ibuprofen, Nurofen® Express.
