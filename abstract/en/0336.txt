high. Needless to say, this nosology can be accompanied by complications, including life­threatening ones, leading to partial or 
complete disability.
The article covers the issues of nosology of acute tonsillitis and aspects of the drugs selection for the topical treatment of this 
disease. Much attention is paid to the effectiveness of the drug’s use of the nitrofuran group (in particular, their representative — 
nitrofural).
Acute tonsillitis will always occupy a leading position in the overall structure of otorhinolaryngological diseases. Without a 
doubt, the treatment of acute tonsillitis come down to a combination of systemic and topical therapy. In the comprehensive 
treatment of acute tonsillitis, an important role is played by gargling repeatedly during the day as the pathogenetic component 
of therapy. When choosing a drug for topical treatment, it is necessary to consider its efficacy, bioavailability, safety, low cost 
compared to other drugs and ease of use. FURACILIN AVEXIMA on the basis of nitrofural has all the necessary benefits over 
alternative  preparations  of  various  antiseptic  groups.  A  convenient,  soluble  form  and  a  reasonable  price  will  allow  patient 
compliance.

AVEXIMA.
