The paper discusses Kinesio Taping method, a universal, effective non-drug therapeutic method of patients with different diseases. Kinesiological tape
is an elastic cotton tape with hypoallergenic acrylic glue, used to restore muscles functional activity, reduce pain and muscle spasticity, and correct sta-
tic-dynamic disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Modern foreign and domestic researchers evaluate area of application and efficacy of Kinesio Tap-
ing method. The basic concept of tape's mechanism of action is clear. The paper provides examples of kinesiotaping techniques (muscular, fascial, lig-
amentous, lymphatic) as well as main features, indications and contraindications of kinesiological tapes application in neurological patients. Examples
of kinesiological tapes application and clinical trials data in patients with Parkinson's disease, post-stroke spasticity, multiple sclerosis, myofascial pain
syndromes, Roth-Bernhardt disease, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, post-traumatic nerves lesions are given. Kinesio Taping method usage in re-
habilitation of pediatric patients with cerebral palsy is observed. In conclusion, area of application, efficacy and safety of this technique are evaluated
in neurological patients.
