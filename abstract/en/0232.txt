Effect of nicorandil on QT dispersion in patients with stable angina pectoris undergoing elective angioplasty: a triple-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled study (abstract)

Nicorandil causes relaxation of the smooth muscle cells of the heart vessels and has a vasodilating effect on the coronary 
vessels. In addition, it has antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective effects by improving reperfusion, and leads to a reduction in 
microvascular damage associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
Aim: to determine the effect of nicorandil on QT interval dispersion (QTd) in patients with stable angina pectoris during elective 
angioplasty.
Patients and Methods: the triple-blind randomized clinical trial was performed on the patients with stable angina pectoris, 
which were candidates for elective coronary angiography between January and October 2016. Patients were randomly divided 
into 2 groups: the main group, which received nicorandil (60 mg divided into three doses: 20 mg before 12 and 3 hours and 
20 mg after PCI), and the control group, which received placebo. All patients underwent electrocardiography 12 hours before 
and 12 hours after PCI. The values of the maximal corrected QT interval (QTc max) and QTd were compared, as well as the 
degree of QTd change (QTd difference before and after angiography).
Results: 90 patients — 55 men and 35 women (mean age 58.6±10.8 years) were divided into two groups of 45 people. Both 
groups were comparable in the main clinical data.
The QTd before angiography had no statistically significant difference between the patients of both groups (control 77.7±17 ms, 
main 80.7±14.2 ms, p=0.371). The QTd after PCI in the nicorandil group was lower than in the control group (48.1±14.2 and 
59.2±15.6 ms, respectively, p<0.05). The decrease rate of QTd had a statistically significant difference between the two groups 
(control: 18.9±11.0, vs. nicorandil: 33.5±9.5 ms, p<0.05).

Conclusions: the results of this study showed that oral administration of nicorandil around the PCI could further reduce QTd 
following the PCI, compared to the control group.
