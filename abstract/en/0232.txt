Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder associated with brain structural changes and mild-to-moderate cognitive impairments assessed by 
neuropsychological testing. Cognitive dysfunction associated with diabetes will have a major impact on global health in the future as diabetes 
is a growing epidemic and many people live to old ages. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes share common important risk factors, i.e., chronic hyper-
glycemia, severe episodes of hypoglycemia, and microvascular complications. To diagnose cognitive impairments in diabetes more carefully, 
practitioners use brain imaging technologies which evaluate morphology, volumetric parameters, macrostructural changes, functional con-
nectivity of signal fluctuations, and metabolites.
This paper reviews the studies over the last two decades to improve our understanding how diadetes, blood glucose, and complications affect 
brain function and structure. We also describe abnormalities revealed by magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spec-
troscopy which are typical of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Keywords: diabetes, cognitive impairments, neuroimaging technologies.
