Statistics show that chronic heart failure (CHF) is still one of the most serious problems in cardiology due to its high prevalence among the world's popula-
tion. Modern requirements for the treatment of patients with CHF suppose the mandatory inclusion of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) in the
complex drug therapy of this contingent of patients. The use of MRA is pathogenetically justified, since hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system with an increase in the content of its final aldosterone product underlies the development and progression of CHF. Currently, in Russia doctors use
two main AMPs - spironolactone and eplerenone. The results of RCTs EPHESUS and EMPHASIS-HF convincingly demonstrated the ability of eplerenone to
reduce the risk of cardiovascular death due to the progression of CHF, as well as the number of hospitalizations for CHF. Advantages of eplerenone in com-
parison with spironolactone are the possibility of using in patients with CHF of different etiology, including after myocardial infarction, almost complete ab-
sence of hormonal side effects, low risk of hyperkalemia at therapeutic doses (25-50 mg / day) and negative drug interactions.
Key words: chronic heart failure, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, spironolactone, eplerenone, cardiovascular diseases.
