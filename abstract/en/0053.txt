The  concept  of  bioregulatory  medicine  originates  from  homotoxicology,  which,  in  turn,  is  associated  with  the  name  of  the 
German physician G. Rekieweg and combines both the views of the founders of homeopathy and a number of provisions of 
natural sciences of the twentieth century medicine. Diseases of the joints and connective tissue were the area of   medicine where 
«antihomotoxic» treatment began to be used as early as in the 1930s and 1940s, when modern rheumatology, in particular 
its theoretical basis, was in its infancy. However, due to a number of circumstances, homotoxicology has remained one of the 
alternative medical practices, which, with undoubtedly growing interest to them in the world, cause a number of objections from 
representatives of official medicine. Currently, homotoxicology with its more than half a century practice has entered the period 
of testing its experience with the tools and methods of evidence-based medicine.
Key words: bioregulatory medicine, homotoxicology, inflammation, connective tissue, rheumatology, Traumeel S, Zeel T.
