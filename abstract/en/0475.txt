Aim: to improve methods of atopic dermatitis (AD) treatment in children on a basis of Maxilac® Baby synbiotic effectiveness 
study in children of the first years of life as part of complex therapy of this pathology.
Patients and Methods: 65 children with AD at the age from 4 months to 2 years, who are divided into two groups, were examined. 
A main group consists of 35 children receiving Maxilac® Baby synbiotic as a part of the complex therapy 1 sachet per day for 
20 days. A comparison group — 30 children receiving only traditional antiallergic therapy, which in the compared groups did 
not differ. Clinical examination methods were performed with an assessment of AD severity on a SCORAD scale, as well as 
laboratory-instrumental and specific allergological methods.
Results: Against the background of ongoing therapy in children of the main group, overall therapeutic effect was 91.4±5.1%, 
and in the comparison group — 80.0±4.3%, p <0.05. This was manifested by a reduction of exacerbation period by 1.5 times — 
from 13.8±1.4 to 9.1±2.3 days, p <0.05. A high individual therapeutic effect (HIE) was observed by 2 times more often in 
the main group of children, and a low HIE was by 2.3 times less frequent than in the comparison group. In the main group of 
children, the SCORAD index decreased by 5 times — from 29.0±4.8 to 5.6±1.8, and in the comparison group by 3 times — from 
29.3±4.7 to 9.8±1,9 points, p <0.05. Long-term positive effects were characterized by a prolongation of remission by 3 times, 
and in 62.8% of patients in the main group there was stable remission during an observation period against the background of 
a 3-fold decrease in a total IgE level and more than 1 class decrease of allergen-specific IgE level, as well as normalization of 
intestinal microbiota.
Conclusion: the obtained results open new possibilities for using Maxilac® Baby synbiotic in children with AD.
