Acute respiratory viral infections are a large, etiologically heterogeneous group of infectious diseases of a viral etiology. Despite 
a wide variety of viruses, all of them have a tropism to the tissues of the respiratory tract, and the infectious process caused 
by them is characterized by a similar clinical picture. Rhinosinusitis and exudative otitis media most often occur in outpatient 
practice.  In  this  case,  the  most  painful  symptom  is  an  acute  cough.  An  important  place  in  the  treatment  of  these  diseases 
belongs to mucoactive drugs and, first of all, mucoregulators. The main representatives of this group are carbocysteine   and 
carbocisteine lysine salt   (Fluifort). The drug activates the synthesis of physiological and less viscous mucus in goblet cells, 
while the amount of secreted mucus decreases. In addition, it has anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects. It takes part in the 
restructuring and regeneration of the damaged mucous membrane of the respiratory tract, reduces the number of goblet cells, 
increases the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy. The drug is well tolerated, and its daily dose can be administered in one scoop. 
After 4 days of treatment, the effectiveness of the drug reaches its maximum and for at least 8 days the rheology of mucus is 
maintained at the same level (pronounced aftereffect).
Key words: acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI), rhinosinusitis, exudative otitis media, acute cough, mucoactive drugs, 
mucoregulators, carbocysteine, Fluifort.
