Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common liver disease affecting approximately one-third of the world's population. NAFLD has
become a serious problem because of its prevalence, difficulties in diagnosis, complex pathogenesis, and the lack of optimal, developed and approved treat-
ment methods. At present, for the treatment of this disease in the stage of simple steatosis, the methods for correcting a lifestyle with the goal of reducing
weight are commonly used. Changing the lifestyle is the first step in the treatment of NAFLD. Reducing the weight by at least 5% reduces the severity of steato-
sis of the liver, and weight loss by 7-10% contributes to the regress of inflammation in the liver. Potentially effective pharmaceutical agents are: weight loss
drugs, hypoglycemic agents (thiazolidinediones, metformin, incretin mimetics), lipid-lowering drugs (statins, omega-3 fatty acids), antioxidants, hepato-
protectors (ursodeoxycholic acid, essential phospholipids). The new strategies and drugs developed today potentially have greater efficacy compared to the
registered drugs. Cirrhosis of the liver in the outcome of NAFLD - is one of the top three causes of liver transplantation (along with HCV infection and alco-
hol). Patients with NAFLD who undergo transplantation have a high risk of fatal outcomes from cardiovascular complications and sepsis, and low risks of
graft failure.
Key words: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, essential phospholipids, obesity.
