Incorrect inhalation technique is a common problem, resulting in a poor delivery of the drug to the respiratory tract, reducing control of the disease and in-
creasing the frequency of exacerbations. At present, nebulizers are widely used in the treatment of lung diseases, which provide medication even in situations
where inhalation systems can not cope with this task. An example of such a situation may be an exacerbation of bronchial asthma (BA) or chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease (COPD), the age of the patients (children or the elderly), and the forms of drugs created specifically for this method of use. The ad-
vantages of nebulizer therapy include the lack of the need for coordination of breathing and drug intake (patients with poor inhalation techniques, elderly,
young children, patients in serious condition, etc.); absence of propellant gas; the possibility of continuous supply of drugs and the use of large doses of the
drug. The medicine quickly enters the target group of the airways, even through the narrowed bronchi.
Key words: nebulizers, inhalation therapy, ultrasonic nebulizers, jet nebulizers, virtual valves, mesh-nebulizers.
