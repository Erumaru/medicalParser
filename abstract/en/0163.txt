Currently, the number of skin defects, in particular, scarring, tends to increase. Modern clinical experience makes it possible to use highly effective, scientif-
ically based approaches to the treatment of scars of various genesis.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness and tolerability of the Kontraktubeks gel in patients with burn and postoperative scars.
Patients and Methods: 30 patients were included in the study. Patients applied Gel Kontraktubeks twice a day for 12 weeks + 6 days. At the 1st, 6th and 12th
weeks. the subjective and objective changes in clinical symptomatology were assessed using the POSAS scale (The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale).
Results of the study: Statistically significant changes in the clinical picture against the backdground of using the Kontraktubeks gel were noted already
6 weeks after the start of the treatment. According to POSAS, evaluated by a doctor, the elasticity of scars at palpation increased on 16.7% (p <0.001). After
12 weeks of application of the gel, a positive dynamics was observed due to a decrease in density, increased elasticity of the scars, and a decrease in the in-
tensity of vascularization. The analysis of subjective criteria for the 6th week of the study revealed a significant reduction in pain, itching and scar density.
At the 12th week after the beginning of treatment with gel Kontraktubeks, a statistically significant decrease in pain and itching was noted from 3 to 1 point
and from 5 to 2 points, respectively, and the color of scars changed from bright pink to blanching.
Conclusion: Kontraktubeks gel is an effective and safe therapy for burn and post-operative scars. During the study there were no serious adverse events, no
additional therapy was required.
