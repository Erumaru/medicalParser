In recent years, ultrasound diagnostics is widely used in clinical practice to visualize pleural effusion and to perform thoracentesis, to identify sub-pleural
airless lung tissue, and to diagnose pneumothorax. The paper describes palliative care unit patient with incurable generalized oncology (right-sided central
lung cancer) complicated by pneumothorax and pleural empyema. The complications which had poor clinical and laboratory manifestations were diagnosed
by ultrasound. Chest X-ray identified right-sided hydropneumothorax only. In contrast, by ultrasound, estimated fluid and air volumes in the right pleural
cavity, fluid nature (inflammatory), and right lung tissue (total atelectasis with abscesses) were assessed as well as small (X-ray negative) amount of fluid
in the left pleural cavity was revealed. In this case, ultrasound was superior to X-ray in terms of diagnostic value in patients with lung diseases. These find-
ings were important to determine further management strategy. Hence, ultrasound advances diagnostic possibilities in pleural and pulmonary pathologies.
Key words: ultrasound diagnostics, pleural effusion, adenocarcinoma, pyopneumothorax, pulmonary atelectasis.
