Intestinal microbiota has important functions, including a metabolic one. Microbiota is actively involved in almost all types of metabolism, digesting various
food ingredients: proteins, fats and carbohydrates, synthesizing vitamins. Important products of bacterial digestion of carbohydrates are short chain fatty
acids (SCFA): acetic, propionic and butyric. Positive effects of SCFA include promotion of bifidobacteria growth, pathogens inhibition, reduction of the level
of toxic and carcinogenic metabolites improvement of Na+, K+, Ca++, Mg++, Zn++ absorption; normalization of GIT motility, body energy supply, enhancement
of liver glycogenesis, reduction of ketone formation and anti-inflammatory action.
Changes in the spectrum of microbial metabolites is one of the causes of intestinal diseases, including colon cancer. Since the end products of microbial me-
tabolism depend both on food character and microbiota composition, intake of ready microbial metabolites—metabiotics—has a more predictable effect.
These drugs, in particular, Hylak forte, are effective in the treatment of a variety of intestinal diseases.
Key words: metabiotics, intestinal microbiota, short chain fatty acids, Hylak forte
