In recent years the syndrome of senile asthenia (frailty syndrome) has become a subject of special interest not only to geriatricians, but also doctors of all
specialties, since it can be the main point of application of medical, rehabilitation and preventive measures in the elderly and senile age. Senile asthenia is
defined as a multifactorial medical syndrome, characterized by a decrease in strength, endurance and physiological functioning, which increases the risk of
dependence and death. The prevalence of senile asthenia varies widely and depends on the age of people included in epidemiological studies, their gender,
race, place of living, and the diagnostic criteria. The article presents data on the prevalence of senile asthenia syndrome and geriatric syndromes. The aut-
hors suggest the variants of senile asthenia diagnosis both according to the classical Fried criteria, and by means of scales / indices of senile asthenia. The
importance of specific approaches in the diagnosis of senile asthenia in elderly patients in the future is shown.
Key words: senile asthenia, "frailty", elderly, aging, complex geriatric evaluation, screening.
