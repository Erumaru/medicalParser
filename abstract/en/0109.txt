The review analyses the pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases formation in patients with non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease. The article considers the role of insulin resistance, pro-inflammatory cytokines, adipocytokines, genetic factors 
in  the  formation  of  atherosclerosis,  diastolic  left  ventricular  dysfunction  and  chronic  heart  failure.  It  is  noted  that  ectopic 
accumulation of adipose tissue can be a key pathogenetic element in the formation of cardiovascular diseases, and therefore 
patients  with  NAFLD  have  a  high  risk  of  their  development.  It  is  shown  that  individuals  with  NAFLD  and  higher  C  protein 
levels have the highest risk of cardiovascular disease. It is demonstrated, that the degree of histological changes in the liver 
in patients with NAFLD correlates with atherosclerotic changes in the carotid arteries. The increase of transaminases in the 
biochemical blood test of patients with NAFLD is an independent risk factor for the formation of heart failure. It is noted that the 
echocardiographic signs of sclerotic changes in the aortic valve have a clear connection with NAFLD. It is shown that PNPLA3 
GG genotype is associated with the severity of atherosclerotic changes in the carotid arteries in young patients with NAFLD.
Key words: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, insulin resistance, risk, cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis.
