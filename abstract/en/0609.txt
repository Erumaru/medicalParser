Summary
The paper summarizes major causes of acquired microbial resistance to antibiotics. The importance of rational use of antibiotics is highlighted. The princi-
ples of rational selection of antibiotics to treat respiratory and ENT infections are described. There are several soluble (dispersed) formulations of antibiotics,
i.e., liquids, syrups, or granules, which facilitate their administration. This aspect is of particular importance in children. Dispersed tablets Flemoxin SoluTab®
(amoxicillin), Flemoclav SoluTab® (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid), Suprax® SoluTab® and Wilprafen® SoluTab (josamycin) are amongst these formulations. The
major characteristic of SoluTab formulation is the inclusion of active ingredient into a microsphere which protects it from the action of digestive acids and
enzymes. The data demonstrate that the repertoire of antibiotics in SoluTab formulation covers the majority of needs in antibacterial agents for the treatment
of common bacterial infections both in adults and children. The drugs are undoubtedly easy-to-use, easy-to-dose, and safe. In addition, they have advantages
in terms of pharmacokinetic properties and low rate of microbial resistance.
Key words: antibiotics, respiratory and ENT infections, dispersed tables, SoluTab.
