Current diagnostic and treatment algorithm for Parkinson’s disease is unable to correct its non-motor manifestations, in particular, pain syndromes. High
occurrence of different pains in Parkinson’s disease significantly impacts physical activity, disease progression, and the quality of life. Current treatment
regimens and strategies of social adaptation should be revised. The paper reviews pathogenesis of pains in neurodegenerative disorders, the role of movement
biomechanics impairment and anxiety depression disorders. The authors addresses their own data on pain occurrence and severity at different stages of
Parkinson’s disease. Case report describes the treatment of acute pain in a woman with Parkinson’s disease. The efficacy and safety of non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in particular, Ketorolac, for pain reduction in neurodegenerative disorders are evaluated. Further studies on pain pathogenesis
in Parkinson’s disease as well as the development of common methodic approaches to the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of pains in neurodegener-
ative disorders are required.
Key words: Parkinson’s disease, pain, -motor manifestations, pain syndrome, social adaptation, Ketorolac.
