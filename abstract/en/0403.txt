Aim: to compare the manifestations of hypercorticism in patients receiving oral glucocorticoids (OGC) for lungs sarcoidosis, and in patients with glucocor-
ticosteroma.
Patients and methods:  the study included 36 patients (26 (72.2%) women and 10 (27%) men, 51 [39.5, 63.7] years) who took OGC for lungs sarcoidosis
(group A) and 32 patients (30 (93.7%) women and 2 (6.3%) men, 41.5 [32.2, 54.0] years) with glucocorticosteroma (group B).
Results: manifestations of hypercorticism were more often observed in group B than A (p <0.05). In group A, with increasing dose of OGC, the frequency of
certain manifestations (matronism, hypokalemia, hypercholesterolemia) increased (r = 0.4, p = 0.01). Arterial hypertension in group A was found in 47.2%
of cases, in group B - 96.9% of cases (p <0.05). In group A, according to densitometry, osteoporosis was recorded in 4 (22.2%) patients, osteopenia - in 2
(11.1%) patients. In group B: osteoporosis was detected in 5 (25%) pts., osteopenia – in 5 (25%) pts. In group A, after a month of taking OGC, impaired glu-
cose tolerance (IGT) was detected in 3 pts, impaired fasting glycemia (IFG) – in 2 pts, IGT + IFG – in 1 pt. In group B: diabetes mellitus (DM) was detected
in 2 pts., IGT - in 6 pts., norm – in 8 pts. 
Conclusion: manifestations of hypercorticism were more often observed in patients of group B than A. In group A the higher the dose of OGC per kilogram of
body weight, the more manifestations of hypercorticism were observed. Disturbances in bone density in both groups occurred with the same frequency. Af-
ter 1 month of taking OGC in group A there were violations of carbohydrate metabolism, which had not previously been diagnosed.
Key words: glucocorticoids, hypercorticism, proximal myopathy, stretch marks, Cushing’s syndrome.
