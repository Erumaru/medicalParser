Cognitive  disorders  that  occur  in  a  significant  number  of  patients  after  a  stroke,  affect  the  household,  social  and  professional  adaptation.  Post-stroke
cognitive impairment (PSCI) of different severity is detected in 20-70% of stroke patients, on average in about half of patients. The risk of PSCI development
depends on various factors: age, the state of cognitive functions prior to stroke, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart pathology, etc. An important
direction in improving the prognosis is the timely treatment of cognitive disorders, but it remains unclear how long the drugs should be used. A number of
studies demonstrate the neuroprotective effect of a non-selective blocker of glutamatergic NMDA receptors of memantine in ischemic brain damage. The ar-
ticle presents a review of the studies confirming its efficacy both in patients with vascular dementia and in the acute stage of stroke, which makes it possible
to use memantine as an early therapy for cognitive impairment and to prevent complications of thrombolytic therapy.
Key words: post-stroke cognitive impairment, vascular dementia, stroke, memantine.
