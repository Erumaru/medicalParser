Pantogam activ (D-, L-hopantenic acid) in the treatment of cognitive and anxiety disorders in patients with arterial 
hypertension (summary)

Aim: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the use of D-, L- hopantenic acid (Pantogam active) in the treatment of cognitive and 
anxiety disorders in patients with arterial hypertension.
Patients and Methods: the study enrolled 80 patients of the cardiology department with the verified diagnosis of hypertension 
and comorbid cognitive and anxiety disorders (50 patients in the main group, 30 patients in the control group). All patients 
received standard antihypertensive therapy. Complex therapy of the patients of the main group included Pantogam active in a 
daily dose from 600 to 1200 mg. Psychopathological and psychometric examinations were conducted, the data were compared 
with the dynamics of physical parameters (ECG, 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, biochemical blood test). The duration of 
therapy with D-, L-gepantenic acid was 28 days.
Results: there was a significant reduction in both cognitive and anxiety disorders in the main group compared with the control 
group and in patients with a prior stroke. The positive dynamics was observed during the treatment period.
Conclusions: authors support the possibility of using D-, L-hopantenic acid (Pantogam active) as a drug of choice with bimodal 
activity (nootropic and tranquilizing) in the treatment of cognitive and anxiety disorders in patients with arterial hypertension. 
It is shown that the therapy with Pantogam active provides a fast (during the first week of therapy) and reliable reduction of 
cognitive and anxiety disorders.
A rapid (in the first week) significant reduction of cognitive and anxiety disorders during the treatment with Pantogam activ 
was noted.
