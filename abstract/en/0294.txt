Practicing dentists, like general practitioners, often encounter an orofacial pain. Correct diagnosis and determination of the tactics of treatment of pain syn-
drome often becomes a difficult task for the clinician. Careful collection of anamnesis and careful analysis of the patient's status before the additional diag-
nosing can be the key to choosing the right algorithm for further activities. The need to have basic knowledge in related disciplines and close cooperation with
specialists in these fields is the basis of an effective approach in the treatment of pain syndrome. This article presents data on the prevalence of orofacial
pain in the general population, the issues of classification and diagnostic criteria for orofacial pain are discussed. The clinical features of odontogenic pain
syndrome are highlighted. The authors give several observations from their own clinical practice as the examples of difficult routes of patients with a long
history of orofacial pain. Careful comparison of the complaints, the history, the clinical course of the disease and the data of objective research helps the
clinician to find a more serious neurological and surgical pathology disguised until now.
Key words: orofacial pain, facial pain, facial neuralgia, facial neuropathy, herpetic neuropathy, myofascial pain syndrome, temporomandibular joint arthritis,
