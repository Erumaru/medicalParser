Aortic stenosis remains the most common cardiac valve disease in elderly and senile patients and presents a challenge for diagnosis and treatment choice.
Recent years have been marked by advances in cardiac surgery, primarily in the development of transcatheter replacement methods (or implantation) of the
aortic valve, which makes it possible to correct aortic stenosis in very elderly patients. However, problems of assessing the risk of interventions associated
with concomitant diseases and care for the elderly patients remain relevant. The presented review analyzes the prevalence of aortic stenosis, its pathogene-
sis, conservative and surgical treatment, summarizes modern approaches to diagnosis and algorithms for aortic stenosis in patients of older age groups in
terms of the work of a multidisciplinary team including the geriatric doctor. The indications for operative intervention in aortic stenosis and recommenda-
tions for choosing the intervention method are described in detail.
Key words: aortic stenosis, elderly age, senile asthenia, multimorbidity, transcatheter replacement of the aortic valve.
