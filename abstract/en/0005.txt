Summary
The paper describes spinal involvement in gout. Historical aspects of the clinical course, diagnosis, and treatment of spinal gout are summarized. A number
of studies demonstrate that this condition is difficult to diagnose. Gout usually affects limb joints (typically, joints of the lower limb) while joints which are
localized near to the trunk are affected rarely. Until recently, spinal gout was considered as atypical, almost casuistic, lesion. The data on potential causes
of gouty tophi formation in the spine, their identification rate, specificity of diagnostics, and clinical manifestations which are typical of spinal tophi are re-
viewed. The advantages of certain imaging techniques, i.e., computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used to visualize axial tophi
as well as some aspects of drug therapy are discussed.
Keywords: gout, spinal gout, tophi.
