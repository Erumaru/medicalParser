The widespread use of antibiotics in the last 80 years has saved millions of human lives, but it has caused another important 
problem — antibiotic-associated violations of human microbiome. In addition to the formation of antibiotic-resistant strains of 
microorganisms, the use of antibiotics significantly destroys the ecology of the human microbiome. Microbiome with dysbiotic 
changes  can  not  perform  the  vital  functions,  such  as  digestive,  synthetic,  as  well  as  providing  colonization  resistance  and 
regulation of the body’s immune system. This review summarizes current studies of the short-term and long-term effects of 
antibiotic use, as well as the possibilities of using probiotics for their correction. Probiotics are living microorganisms, mostly 
the representatives of obligate human microflora, which, when ingested into the gastrointestinal tract of a person in sufficient 
quantity, retain their activity, vitality and have a positive impact on human health. The most frequent and clinically significant 
negative  effect  of  antibiotic  therapy  is  antibiotic-associated  diarrhea.  The  article  describes  the  possibilities  of  preventing 
the antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which include, along with the rational antibiotic therapy, the use of eubiotics — pre- and 
probiotics.
Key words: antibiotics, probiotics, children, lactobacillus GG, microbiome, gastrointestinal tract, microbiota.
