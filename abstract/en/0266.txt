Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a topical interdisciplinary problem. Various non-inflammatory pathogenetic mechanisms of CPP syndrome require a differenti-
ated approach to its management. The main pathogenetic factors of non-inflammatory CPP syndrome include myofascial syndrome, microcirculation disor-
ders in pelvic vessels and pelvic neuropathy. Modern instrumental and clinical diagnostic methods can detect various violations of pelvic area biomechanics
and exclude pelvic organs diseases. A wide range of medications for CPP management opens up the possibility of combined pathogenetic and symptomatic
treatment of this syndrome. Local methods and local treatment of pain have an important role. Besides, there are many promising and effective non-drug ther-
apies, helpful in case of drug-resistant non-inflammatory CPP. Manual therapy, Kinesio Taping and biofeedback methods are particularly important. Despite
a big variety of treatments, CPP syndrome remains a challenge for professionals in different fields of medicine and requires further investigation in order to
find new and optimize existing approaches of its management.
Key words: chronic pelvic pain, Kinesio Taping method, pain management, biofeedback, L-lysine aescinat.
