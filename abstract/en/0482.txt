Stroke  is  one  of  the  leading  causes  of  morbidity,  mortality  and  disability  worldwide.  Stroke  risk  factors  include  lifestyle  factors,  as  well 
as genetic factors, specifically family history of stroke, genetic gender differences, specific risk genes and epigenetic factors and complex 
interaction of genes and environmental factors. At present genetic polymorphisms, associated with elevated risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic 
stroke are extensively studied. Elucidation of genetic factors may improve our understanding of stroke pathogenesis and recognition of high 
risk populations. These studies are aimed at the identification of new approaches to treatment and primary prevention of stroke. The results 
of current large-scale genome-wide association studies, aimed at the discovery of genetic risk factors of stroke are presented in this article. 
Effective stroke risk prognosis in individual patients may become possible with the increase of identified genes, associated with high stroke risk 
and identification of rare genetic variants using genome-wide sequencing and mathematical algorithms of risk estimation.
Keywords: stroke, genetics, gene polymorphism, genome-wide association studies, personalizied medicine.
