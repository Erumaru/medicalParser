Obesity  is  associated  with  many  adverse  reproductive  events,  including  ovarian  failure,  disorder  of  menstrual  function, 
deterioration in the quality of oocytes, negative impact on the receptor apparatus of the endometrium, increase in the risk of 
relative sterility and inevitable miscarriage. In the development pathogenesis of these disorders, a significant role is played by 
the pathological effect of free fatty acids, lipotoxicity, impaired insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance.
In this review, we discuss the unfavorable effects of obesity on reproductive function, studies concerning the mechanisms of 
their development and preventive treatment of infertility and adverse outcomes of pregnancy by enhancement of body mass 
and coping with insulin resistance.
Weight loss in women with overweight or obesity is required during the preconception period as an effective measure to enhance 
fertility and improve pregnancy outcomes. Drug administration for the obesity treatment contributes not only to the efficiency 
improvement of weight loss, but also affects the pathogenetic triggers such as lipotoxicity and insulin resistance. Combination 
drug Reduxin®Met, on the basis of metformin and sibutramine, can effectively deal with these negative factors.
Key words: obesity, fertility, reproduction, preconception period, preventive treatment of infertility, sibutramine, metformin, 
Reduxin®Met.
