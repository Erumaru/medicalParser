Summary
Osteoarthrosis (OA) is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders which often results in disability. OA is considered as a heterogeneous cluster of di-
seases with various etiology but similar morphological, biological, and clinical features. Pathogenic process affects articular cartilage, subchondral bone, li-
gaments, synovial membrane, and periarticular tissues. Tissue remodeling mediated by proinflammatory molecules and vascular disorders which provoke in-
traosseous hypertension and focal tissue hypoxia play an important role in OA pathogenesis. The paper discusses current treatment approaches to OA ba-
sed on the recent European, American, and Russian guidelines. The combination of pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological methods as well as manda-
tory patient education are the key components of OA treatment. The primary goal of medical therapy is to reduce pain with analgesics and non-steroidal an-
ti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). When prescribing analgesics, one should consider the presence of reactive synovitis, periarticular tissue involvement, vas-
cular and neuropathic components, and pain behavior. In addition to fast-acting drugs, there are symptomatic slow-acting drugs for OA (SYSADOA) which
prevent cartilage destruction and disease progression. According to the international and Russian guidelines, the treatment should be personalized and con-
sider patient’s characteristics and comorbidities.
