Sleep disturbance often accompanies pain syndrome associated with herniated intervertebral disc (HIVD). Studies demonstrate 
a two-way relationship between sleep disorders and pain intensification.
Aim: to evaluate the efficacy of combined gabapentin and melatonin therapy of pain syndrome in patients with HIVD.
Patients and Methods: the study included 39 patients with acute low back pain. The first group included 21 patients who 
received conventional therapy, the second group — 18 patients who received additionally 3 mg of melatonin before sleep.  
All  patients  received  gabapentin  300–900  mg/day  and  rehabilitation.  Treatment  efficacy  was  assessed  using  VAS, 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Oswestry Disability Index on 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks of the treatment and 3 months after 
the treatment.
Results: patients in the second group had a faster and more pronounced regression of pain syndrome with improved sleep 
quality during the acute period. No significant differences between groups at 3 months after treatment were observed.
Conclusion: inclusion of melatonin into the treatment plan of patients with pain syndrome associated with HIVD increases the 
treatment efficacy and can be recommended as a part of multimodal treatment of these patients.
Key words: pain syndrome, sleep disturbance, herniated intervertebral disc, lumbar spine, melatonin, gabapentin.
