Postoperative pain remains an important problem for both surgeons and their patients. Optimization of postoperative analgesia is an important 
issue in terms of achieving clinical goals as soon as possible and minimizing complications and side effects of medication support. At present, 
the concept of multimodal analgesia is relevant, based on the combination of several drugs that differ in terms of their application points, but 
have an unidirectional effect on the mechanisms of pain realization and reduction of local hormonal response to the injury. This approach 
allows to achieve maximum analgesic effect at lower doses of specific drugs. At the same time, the dose-dependent frequency and severity of 
side effects of drugs decrease.
Medicines  that  implement  the  mechanisms  of  influence  on  both  the  peripheral  and  the  central  link  of  the  pain  pattern  are  now  drugs  of 
choice. The main component in the schemes of multimodal anesthesia are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. As an example, we can cite 
Ketonal® (SJSC “Sandoz”), which in combination with other analgesic drugs, as well as in monotherapy, is able to quickly relieve severe pain 
syndrome and minimal side effects, which makes it an important component of various schemes of postoperative management.
