Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence over the past 20 years has ubiquitously doubled to more than 40%. Apart from the 
traditional  risk  factors  for  cardiovascular  complications  (CVC)  development  in  patients  with  NAFLD,  such  as  obesity,  diabetes  mellitus, 
metabolic  syndrome,  etc.,  new  ones  has  been  distinguished:  an  increase  in  the  pericardial  fat  thickness;  endothelial  and  mitochondrial 
dysfunctions;  intima-media  complex  thickening;  an  increase  in  C-reactive  protein  level;  gender;  age;  hypertension;  hyperlipidemia  and 
smoking. These factors, according to modern concepts, are associated with the CVD development risk, which defines NAFLD as the CVC 
development predictor independently of other risk factors. In this regard, the range of diseases that forms NAFLD, significantly expands and 
includes steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, hypertension, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. 
Such diverse disease clinical manifestations are the polymorbidity determining factors in patients with NAFLD, which contributes to the late 
disease diagnosis. Nowadays, there is no standardized method for the NAFLD diagnosis, despite the abundance of various diagnostic methods 
allowing manifesting liver disease. Timely NAFLD diagnosis will allow choosing the optimal treatment and prophylaxis options that prevent 
further progression of both liver disease and associated conditions.
