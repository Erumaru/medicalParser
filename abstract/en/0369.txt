Topical corticosteroids and local anaesthetics have been used for many years to relieve symptoms of anorectal diseases, such as pain, pruritus and bleeding.
This article addresses clinical manifestation and symptoms of anorectal disease, main principles of treatment of haemorrhoidal disease, with special attention
to topical therapeutic agents for the symptomatic treatment and their ingredients (protectants, analgesics, vasoconstrictors, astringents, anaesthetics, ker-
atolytics, analgesics and steroids). The paper highlights why topical medications are necessary for the treatment of anorectal diseases, especially of inflam-
matory symptoms of haemorrhoids, anal eczema and others, particularly with respect to improving the quality of life of patients living with the pain and dis-
comfort associated with such symptoms. Corticosteroid potency is discussed using the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system. It also
demonstrates the efficacy and safety of combinations of topical corticosteroids and local anaesthetics in cream and suppository through reference to clinical
trials data and real life clinical experience with these products.
Key words: hemorrhoidal disease, anorectal diseases, topical corticosteroids, local anesthetics, combination therapy.
