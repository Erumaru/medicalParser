The spine and spinal cord injuries are often associated with a disorder of voluntary urination, which is caused by a violation of conduction of the spinal tract.
The clinical picture in this case is characterized by heterogeneity of forms of neurogenic disorders of the lower urinary tract function. Close cooperation of
neurologists and urologists is necessary to make an adequate assessment of the patient's condition and selection of the treatment method. The article presents
a modern view of the problem and an analysis of existing methods of correction of urological complications of spine and spinal cord injuries. The mechanism
of normal urination and the nature of its disorder in patients with complicated spine trauma is described. The article presents clinical disorders characterized
by variability and dependence on the nature and severity of damage, as well as the time that has elapsed since the injury. A close relationship of specialists

indications for the use of intermittent catheterization.
Key words: spinal cord injury, neurogenic urination disorders, intermittent catheterization, magnetic stimulation.
