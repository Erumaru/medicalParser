The article deals with the problem of prosopalgia as a facial pain syndrome which has various classifications, different 
causes and a large number of treatment options. Particular attention is paid to prosopalgia with a neuropathic component 
of pain. The relevance of the study is due to the difficulties in choosing the treatment for the patients with different types 
of prosopalgia and the need to objectify the results of the treatment.
Aim: to evaluate the state of the first and second periods of exteroceptive suppression (ES1 and ES2) in patients with 
prosopalgia before and after treatment with gabapentin.
Patients and Methods: patients with prosopalgia of various etiologies were included in the study, 23 people in total. We 
used the clinical method and electroneuromyographic (ENMG) method, namely the method of exteroceptive suppression 
(ES) with evaluation of the duration of ES1 and ES2 before and after treatment with gabapentin.
Results: the role of exteroceptive suppression in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain in prosopalgia was determined. 
The clinical outcome of using gabapentin was a decrease in the severity of pain syndrome. All patients reported a decrease 
in the pain syndrome after 2-3 days from the start of the gabapentin therapy; the pain attacks also became shorter and 
less frequent. Stabilization of ES parameters was achieved after gabapentin treatment.
Conclusion: the results of the study showed that the drug gabapentin can be used for the treatment of prosopalgia with a 
neuropathic nature of pain by improving the control of pain on the stem and suprasegmental structures.
Key words: gabapentin, prosopalgia, neuropathic pain, exteroceptive suppression, electroneuromyography.
