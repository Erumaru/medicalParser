Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGD) are well known throughout the centuries. However, the concept of FGD has appeared 
recently, and now they are considered as the most common pathology of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), which is most often 
registered in young children, bringing the sufferings and a decrease in the quality of life not only to the kid but also to his parents 
and to all family members. To date, many aspects of the etiology and pathogenesis of various forms of functional disorders of the 
GIT have a serious evidentiary basis, which is reflected in the Roman criteria IV (2016). Such disorders are caused by combined 
morphological and physiological abnormalities associated with violations of motility of the gastrointestinal tract, protective 
mucous barrier, immune function, intestinal microbiota, visceral hypersensitivity, and disorders of the central nervous system. 
In the Roman criteria (2016), many aspects of the FGD are specified, an algorithm for diagnosing and managing such patients 
is given, taking into account modern views on pathogenesis and the current possibilities of drug therapy.
Key words: functional gastrointestinal disorders, children of early age, infantile colic, approaches to therapy, simethicone,
