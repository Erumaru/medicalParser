Currently, both inpatient and outpatient clinical practices commonly face comorbidities as a result of population ageing and improvements in diagnostic
tools. As a consequence, most disorders should be considered from the viewpoint of comorbidity. Pathological process interactions affect disease course
while the therapy requires the analysis of medication effects, their impact on organs and systems as well as adverse side effects. The paper discusses treat-
ment modalities for pain syndrome in comorbid patients, the aspects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and potentiation of NSAID anal-
gesic effect with neurotropic B vitamins. Authors’ experience with different NSAID regimens (monotherapy or in combination with B vitamin injections) pre-
scribed in patients with back pains and comorbid somatic conditions is summarized. Complex treatment provides more rapid pain relief and shortens the du-
ration of pain recurrence period.
Key words: pain, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lornoxicam, thiamin, pyridoxine, cyanocobalamin.
