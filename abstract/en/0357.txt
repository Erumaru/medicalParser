The development of modern technologies and software has opened before radiotherapists and oncologists the new opportunities for the use of interstitial ra-
diation therapy, namely a high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. This method provides more effective and economically efficient treatment of the patients
with prostate cancer with both a localized and regional variant of the disease. The article briefly describes the stages of development of HDR brachytherapy
of prostate cancer. The main advantages and disadvantages of the method are reflected in accordance with the data of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) as compared to the low-dose rate brachytherapy. Methodical recommendations on the application of the method are given, as well as summary
data on the effectiveness of HDR brachytherapy both in combination with remote radiation therapy and alone. The article shows the results of HDR
brachytherapy application in the Medical Radiological Research Center named after A.F. Tsyba. A clinical example is given to demonstrate the possibility of
using this technique in the treatment of recurrent prostate cancer after previously performed low-dose rate brachytherapy.
Key words: prostate cancer, interstitial radiation therapy, high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, Ir-192, indications, contraindications.
