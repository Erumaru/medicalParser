Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (multiple endocrine tumors syndrome, MEN 2) combines a group of diseases 
characterized  by  the  development  of  a  tumor  and/or  hyperplasia  (diffuse,  nodular)  of  the  cells  of  neuroectodermal 
origin in two endocrine organs and more. The combination of medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma and lesions 
of  the  parathyroid  glands  is  referred  to  MEN  2A  (Sipple  syndrome).  The  combination  of  medullary  thyroid  cancer, 
pheochromocytoma  and  multiple  ganglioniomas  of  the  mucous  membrane  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  is  referred  to  
MEN 2B (Gorlin syndrome). To prove that relatives have a family form of medullary thyroid cancer, it is necessary to confirm 
the absence of a pheochromocytoma or primary hyperparathyroidism in two or more generations of the family. With the 
incidence  in  only  one  generation,  caution  is  needed  regarding  the  risk  of  developing  pheochromocytoma  (MEN  2A).  In  
MEN 2A, most authors note the changes in the type of recombination in chromosome 10, in a region located near the centromere 
in the locus region of 10q11.2. This part contains the RET proto-oncogene, so all sporadic observations of medullary thyroid 
cancer  should  be  checked  for  a  RET  mutation.  The  review  deals  with  the  classification,  description  of  the  diagnosis  and 
treatment of this pathology, and gives an example of a clinical case of this disease.
Key  words:  multiple  endocrine  neoplasia  syndrome  type  2,  Sipple  syndrome,  Gorlin  syndrome,  medullary  thyroid  cancer, 
pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism, RET mutation.
