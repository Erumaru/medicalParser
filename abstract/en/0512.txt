At the 19th annual congress of the European Venous Forum, which was held in Athens in June 28–30, 2018, the long-awaited 
updated recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of chronic venous diseases (CVD) were presented, the full text 
of  which  can  be  found  in  the  June  issue  of  the  International  Angiology  publication.  This  publication  aims  to  familiarize 
the  practitioners  with  one  of  the  key  sections  of  the  new  European  recommendations  on  pharmacotherapy  for  CVD.  The 
primary  agents  of  medical  treatment  of  CVD  remain  venoactive  drugs  (phleboprotectors).  Along  with  the  venoactive 
drugs, pentoxifylline and sulodexide are widely used in the pharmacotherapy of venous trophic ulcers. In recent years, a 
personalized approach has been approved to treating a particular patient and optimizing the choice of a pharmacological 
drug, depending on the presence of specific symptoms and syndromes. For this purpose, an NNT (number-needed-to-treat) 
indicator is used — the number of patients who need to be treated to obtain a positive result in one patient. Thus, the ideal 
NNT should be equal to one. Modern and adequate phlebotropic therapy, taking into account new recommendations at all 
stages of the pathological process from C0s to C6, regardless of the key pathogenetic mechanism — reflux or occlusion, 
expands our capabilities in control of CVD.
Key words: chronic venous diseases, pharmacotherapy, venoactive drugs.
