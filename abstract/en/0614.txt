Summary
Infectious inflammatory diseases of the external ear are very common in our population. Inadequate treatment results in recurrences and chronicity of these
conditions. Development and searching for novel methods of rational therapy of external otitis is of importance for clinical otorhinolaryngology.
In recent decades, microbial landscape in external otitis has significantly changed. In localized inflammation of the external ear (furuncle), Staphylococcus
aureus is the most common etiologic agent while diffuse inflammation is mainly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or, in a number of cases, by fungi and
microbial associations (bacterial, fungal, mixed). Resistance of microbial flora significantly worsens treatment outcomes. When treating external otitis, top-
ical drugs should be used. Topical drugs provide higher concentration of antibacterial agent in the focus of infection. Since antibiotic in a sub-therapeutic
dosage does not exert prolonged influence on the microbe (in contrast to systemic antibacterial therapy), the risk of antibacterial resistance is minimal.
Amongst topical drugs for the treatment of external otitis, Anauran which has antibacterial and analgesic effects is of special interest.
Key words: acute otitis externa, etiological therapy, topical antibacterial agents.
