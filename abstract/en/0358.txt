Treatment of cancer in elderly patients is commonly considered by doctors as a challenge,  firstly, because of the deterioration of the work of organs and sys-
tems of the body, and secondly, the concomitant therapy of intercurrent diseases. Therefore, oncologists, as a rule, do not prescribe to elderly patients
(70 years and older) the antitumor drugs, because of their excessive toxicity and adverse effects. However, over the last decade, doctors have begun to pay
more attention not to the chronological age of such patients, but to a functional condition assessed by the integrated geriatric scale and the comorbidity cri-
teria. If we take the cases of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), we will see that almost the majority of patients with this disease are
over 70 years old, including very elderly, over 80 years old. Some medicinal agents could significantly prolong the life of such patients. For reasons related
to comorbidity the elderly patients, as a rule, were not actively involved into randomized clinical trials of drugs for the treatment of mCRPC, This review con-
siders the cases when the elderly and very elderly patients with mCRPC received the treatment during the clinical trials.
Key words: prostate cancer, elderly patients, castrate resistance
