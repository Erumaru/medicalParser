The article discusses the topical issues of the drugs interchangeability. It is believed, that the use of generic drugs significantly 
reduces the cost of health care. However, if the patient buys a low-quality generic instead of an original drug, he at best receives 
a less effective remedy, but most often — significant undesirable drug reactions, for which the money, time and efforts of the 
patient and his family are spent. Bioequivalent reproduced medicines (generics) are not always similar in effectiveness and 
safety to original drugs. The relatively low cost of generics is their main and the only advantage over the original drugs. The 
reasons for the low cost of generics may be obsolete or simplified production technologies, use of low-quality substances, lack 
of comparative clinical studies with the original drugs; absence of multi-year studies of the long-term consequences of therapy. 
The article gives examples of the non-equivalence of reproduced drugs, presented in the domestic pharmaceutical market, in 
particular, generic preparations of bisoprolol, which differ from the original drug both in efficiency and safety.
Key  words:  original  preparations,  reproduced  drugs,  generics,  bisoprolol,  interchangeability,  bioequivalence,  therapeutic 
equivalence, safety, efficacy.
