The article considers epidemiological and pathogenetic aspects of metabolic therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2) and its complications. The causes of
the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in patients with diabetes mellitus 2: a violation of the supply and utilization of glucose in cardiomyocytes,
accumulation of final glycation products and mitochondrial dysfunction. The role of metabolic therapy with the use of the amino acid taurine in diabetes and
cardiovascular diseases is described. The antioxidant, vascular, hypolipidemic and gigolglycemic effects of taurine, its role in the pathology of coronary ves-
sels, the mechanisms of ischemia-reperfusion and the possibility of its use in chronic heart failure are considered in detail. The article provides arguments
for the possibility of including taurine preparations into the complex treatment of diabetes mellitus 2. It has been shown that the use of taurine in the com-
plex therapy of carbohydrate metabolism disorders and diabetic macroangiopathies, according to the conducted studies, contributes to the normalization of
carbohydrate, fat metabolism, cardiac muscle and vascular wall, which significantly improves the course of vascular pathology, associated with DM 2.
Key words: diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, taurine.
