Aim. To study the efficacy of combinations of moxonidine with hydrochlorothiazide and hydrochlorothiazide with losartan in stage 2-3 hypertension and
metabolic syndrome by the parameters of 24-hour blood pressure (BP) monitoring, insulin resistance, and anthropometry.
Patients and methods. 50 patients with hypertension and metabolic syndrome were enrolled in the study. 24 patients received moxonidine with hy-
drochlorothiazide and 26 patients received hydrochlorothiazide with losartan. 24-hour BP monitoring, anthropometry, and the assessment of insulin resis-
tance were performed before and 6 months after the treatment.
Results. Both combinations demonstrated similar efficacy in terms of target BP levels. In addition, moxonidine + hydrochlorothiazide improved insulin re-
sistance and anthropometric parameters in patients with stage 2-3 hypertension and abdominal obesity.
Conclusions. Combinations of moxonidine with hydrochlorothiazide and hydrochlorothiazide with losartan can be recommended for hypertension and meta-
bolic syndrome. The effect of moxonidine + hydrochlorothiazide on insulin resistance is superior to that of hydrochlorothiazide + losartan.
Key words: metabolic syndrome, hypertension, insulin resistance, moxonidine, hydrochlorothiazide, losartan, complex therapy.
