The article presents data on the role of the new biochemical marker copeptin - the C-end part of pro-vasopressin, in diagnosis and prognosis in patients with
non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome.
Patients and Methods: the study included 128 people (52 people with verified diagnosis of non-ST elevation acute myocardial infarction, 58 people with un-
stable angina (UA), 18 with unconfirmed coronary events), selected according to I/E criteria. All patients were examined according to the standards of med-
ical care, supplemented by a specific definition of the quantitative level of the human copeptin peptide.
Results: the level of copeptin in the first 3 hours from the manifestation of the pain syndrome was significantly higher in patients of Group 1, with a verified
diagnosis of NSTEAMI in hospital, compared to the group of patients with UA or with unconfirmed ACS (M ± σ, 2.6 ± 1 , 8 ng / ml, median - 2.1 ng / ml against
0.7± 0.4 ng / ml, median - 0.70 ng / ml and 0.2 ± 0.1 ng / ml, median - 0, 2 ng / ml, respectively, p <0.0001).
Conclusions: copeptin, determined in the first 3 hours from the manifestation of ACS, has a high positive predictive value for the development of acute my-
ocardial focal damage at a level of ˃0.94 ng / ml (95% CI, 71.38-89.96). 71.38-89.96). The level of copeptin <0.5 ng / ml had 100% negative prognostic val-
ue in patients with NSTEACS for the first 3 hours from the ACS debut (95% CI, 82.41-100.00). The combination of double testing for copeptin and troponin T
is a highly specific test in the diagnosis of myocardial necrosis in patients with NSTEACS in the first 3 hours from the ACS debut, while troponin T values less
than 58 ng / L and copeptin <0.5 ng / ml allow to exclude AMI with a probability of 95.55% (95% CI 91.47-98.65). 
Key words: copeptin, vasopressin, non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, troponin T.
