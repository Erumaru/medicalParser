Chronic  heart  failure  (CHF)  remains  a  significant  health  problem  associated  with  high  hospitalization  rates,  mortality  and 
treatment costs, despite the advances in therapy for CHF and the management of risk factors associated with it. In the INTER-
CHF study, there were significant differences in the mortality of patients with CHF in countries with different levels of income. 
That is, an opportunity to receive modern medical care plays a significant role in outcome of CHF treatment. Studies of recent 
years have shown that the optimal drug therapy for CHF is a small number of patients, and most often due to non-prescription 
of  mineralocorticoid  receptor  antagonists  (MCRA)  when  it  is  necessary.  This  review  deals  with  causes  of  this  situation, 
and also discusses how to overcome it. In particular, necessity to use selective MCRA (eplerenone) instead of non-selective 
(spironolactone) in order to reduce the number of possible side effects. Also, use of eplerenone in early stages of development of 
the disease, in particular, in patients who underwent myocardial infarction, possible mechanisms of action, as well as possibility 
of using eplerenone generics to increase compliance of patients to this therapy are handled.
Key words: chronic heart failure, optimal medical therapy for chronic heart failure, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, 
eplerenone.
