Osteoarthrosis (OA) is one of the most common rheumatic disorders. OA is characterized by increased catabolism of articular cartilage matrix, bone tissue
remodeling, and synovial inflammation with the production of inflammatory mediators. Interleukin-1 (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, IL-6, IL-15, IL-
17, and IL-18 are pathogenically important. The aims of OA therapy are to slow disease progressing, to reduce pain and functional disorders, to prevent dis-
ability, and to improve the quality of life. Complex treatment approach should include both pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological methods. The first
step of non-pharmacological management is patient education. Medical exercises (static and dynamic) are obligatory in OA. ESCEO working group recom-
mends to start basic treatment of knee OA with slow-acting symptom-modifying drugs. Various studies demonstrate structure-modifying (chondroprotective)
effects of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate. Teraflex is a combined agent with chondroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects which prevents
OA progression (in long-term use).
Key words: osteoarthrosis, chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine sulfate, Teraflex.
