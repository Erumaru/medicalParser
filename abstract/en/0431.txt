Objective. To study the effect of nicorandil on the elasticity of the great vessels, cardiac functional parameters and quality of life in patients with coronary
heart disease (CHD). 
Patients and methods. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of nicorandil was attended by 154 patients with stable angina III functional
class (FC), divided into 2 comparable age and sex group. Study duration was 12 months.
Results. In the group treated with nicorandil compared with placebo, the number of angina attacks and nitrate intake of short-significantly reduced, improved
elastic properties of large arteries, improved quality of life. In a cohort of patients with CHD and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45% nikorandil
addition to standard therapy has improved the systolic function of the heart and reduce left ventricular remodeling. 
Conclusion. The use of nicorandil in addition to standard therapy can not only improve the quality of life in patients with coronary artery disease, but also
a positive impact on the state of elasticity of blood vessels and morpho-functional parameters of the heart.
Key words: vascular stiffness; CAD, quality of life, nicorandil.
