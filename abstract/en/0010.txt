pean Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) developed basic principles of OA treatment. According to these
recommendations, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be used carefully whereas symptomatic slow-acting drugs for OA (SYSDOA) are
effective and safe. Slow-acting drugs (e.g., chondroprotectors) should be prescribed early for OA. Amongst these agents, glucosamine is of special interest.
European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations 2003 support its chondroprotective action. The paper summarizes the results of multiple
studies which indicate that glucosamine is safe and reduces pain and improves function in OA. Long-term randomized studies demonstrate that glucosami-
ne prevents progressive knee joint space narrowing in OA.
Keywords: osteoarthrosis, complex management approach, slow-acting drugs, glucosamine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
