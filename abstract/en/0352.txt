The continuous parallel increase in the number of people suffering from metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
indicates a close pathogenetic relationship of these pathologies. Therefore it is necessary to form approaches to the treatment 
of the latter, taking into account various components of the metabolic syndrome. The review considers both the pathogenetic 
relationships of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic syndrome as well as current trends in diagnosis and treatment. 
The summary of information on the leading risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease clearly demonstrates the key role of 
various manifestations of the metabolic syndrome in it’s development. The importance of correction of various manifestations 
of the metabolic syndrome as the main method of preventing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is pointed out. Modern diagnostic 
algorithms  using  the  innovative  non-invasive  techniques  are  presented.  The  possibilities  of  personalization  of  treatment 
approaches are indicated depending on the presence or absence of violations of carbohydrate metabolism and the stage of liver 
damage. The place of bariatric surgery as a personalized approach to the treatment of patients with morbid forms of obesity is 
defined. Finally, the prospects for further development of methods for treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are discussed.
Key words: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome, fibrosis markers, fibrosis score, glitazones, еssential 
phospholipids.
