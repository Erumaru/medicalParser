The article is devoted to reassessment of the role of beta-blockers (BB) in the arterial hypertension (AH) treatment, reflected 
in  the  new  version  of  joint  recommendations  on  AH  of  the  European  Society  of  Cardiology  and  the  European  Society  of 
Hypertension 2018. BB can be prescribed as antihypertensive drugs in presence of specific clinical situations such as chronic 
heart failure (CHF), angina pectoris, a previous myocardial infarction (MI), need for rhythm control, pregnancy or its planning. 
In addition, they can be used as a third-step drug in resistance to the therapy. As absolute contraindications to BB included 
bradycardia  (heart  rate  less  than  60  beats  per  minute)  and  excluded  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease.  Prerequisites 
of this reassessment are considered and analyzed, a data of the last meta-analyzes devoted to drugs of the first line of AH 
treatment is presented. Indications for use of different BB are considered. Features of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics 
of clinical application of various salts of metoprolol (succinate and tartrate) are presented. A data on efficacy and safety of 
metoprolol succinate use in AH in combination with coronary heart disease, CHF is presented.
Key words: beta-adrenoblockers, metoprolol, metoprolol succinate, Betaloc® ZOK, arterial hypertension, chronic heart failure, 
coronary heart disease, cardiovascular diseases.
