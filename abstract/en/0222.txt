Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common chronic conditions in children, however, it is still frequently underdiagnosed 
and undertreated. AR is not a life-threatening condition but lack of good control over AR symptoms results in a significant 
decrease in quality of life and affects school performance and work. AR is considered the most important risk factor for asthma 
development.
AR  diagnostics  are  built  around  clinical  history  and  allergy  testing.  The  AR  therapy  is  based  on  the  use  of  intranasal 
corticosteroids  and  second-generation  antihistamines.  Both  drug  groups  are  highly  effective  and  have  good  safety  profile. 
First-generation antihistamines, in contrast, have a significant sedative effect, associated with reduced academic performance, 
and should not be routinely used in AR patients. Specific immunotherapy is highly effective in patients with well-established 
cause of symptoms.
Importance of standartised, evidenced-based approach to AR diagnosis and management is highlighted in both National and 
International guidelines. This review considers the current approaches to diagnosis and management of AR.
Key words: allergy, allergic diseases, allergic rhinitis, hay fever.
