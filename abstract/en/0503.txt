bioavailability and safety. Particular attention is paid to the role of combined local preparations, such as Anauran, which includes two antibacterial compo-
nents (polymyxin B and neomycin sulfate), as well as a local anesthetic (lidocaine). Anauran, which has a powerful antimicrobial effect, is the drug of choice
for the treatment of external otitis.
