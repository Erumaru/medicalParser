Aim: to evaluate the effectiveness of antiviral therapy (AVT) with interferon compared with monotherapy in children with chronic hepatitis C 
(CGC).
Patients and Methods: the study included 173 children with CGC aged 3 to 17 years old. 2 schemes of treatment of chronic hepatitis C used in 
real clinical practice compared in the study. The patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 – 122 children who received an AVT course with 
Peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, group 2 — 51 children who received a monotherapy course with Interferon alpha-2a.
Results:  combined  AVT  efficiency  is  significantly  higher  than  the  monotherapy  efficiency  with  Interferon  alpha-2a  (p  <0.05).  Sustained 
virological response (SVR) was achieved in 49.0% with G1, RF and in 87.8% with G2, 3, p<0.001 in group 1. In group 2, SVR was reached in 
28.0% of children with G1 and in 54.0% with G2, 3 (p <0.001). Prognostic factors analysis for the therapy effectiveness has shown that the 
presence of a fast or early virological response is a positive response prognostic sign to therapy for all virus genotypes.
Conclusion:  comparison  of  two  treatment  types  demonstrated  the  advantage  of  the  combined  AVT  regimen  over  Interferon  alpha-2a 
monotherapy in evaluating the efficacy 24 weeks after completion of treatment.
Keywords: chronic hepatitis C, combined antiviral therapy, interferon, children, efficacy.
