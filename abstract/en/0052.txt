Osteoporosis (OP) is the most common form of the disease, in which a progressive decrease in bone strength is associated 
with the onset of menopause. By their medical significance, the metabolic diseases of the skeleton take the fourth place after 
cardiovascular,  oncological  diseases  and  diabetes  mellitus.  Osteoporosis  has  no  specific  early  symptomatology,  except  for 
already happened fractures. In this regard, the awareness and consideration of risk factors becomes particularly important 
for the prevention and diagnosis of the disease. A reliable diagnosis of osteoporosis is based on densitometry. Diagnosis of OP 
includes assessment of risk factors for osteoporosis and fractures, and dual X-ray energy absorptiometry. The most important 
task  is  a  widespread  introduction  of  modern  methods  of  prevention  and  treatment  of  osteoporosis  into  practice.  Particular 
attention is paid to an adequate intake of vitamin D and its concentration in the serum is important for the health of bones and 
calcium-phosphorus metabolism, as well as for the optimal functioning of many organs and tissues.
Key words: osteoporosis, diagnosis, risk factors, prevention, treatment, calcium, alfacalcidol.
