Migraine vertigo is common in the population and among the patients with other complaints, in particular the headache of tension. The prevalence of vertigo
is about 20-30%, with dominance in women. The clinical and pathophysiological connection between migraine and vertigo is still unclear, approaches to the
treatment of vestibular migraine (VM) have not been developed.
Aim: to determine the nature of vertigo in patients with migraine with aura and without aura, and pathogenetic mechanisms of their connection.
Patients and methods: 152 patients having migraine with aura (24 people) and without aura (128 people) were included into the study. All patients underwent
a clinical neurological examination, and patients with a history of vertigo had an additional comprehensive otoneurological examination: videoistagmogra-
phy, video pulse test, caloric assay, diagnostic positional maneuvers, and tone threshold audiometry. A questionnaire study of patients with migraine, who
complained of dizziness, included: otoneurological questionnaire; and Dizziness Assessment Rating Scale.
Results: 58.6% of patients with migraine complained of vertigo, 2.6% had signs of peripheral vestibulopathy, 13.8% had vestibular migraine (VM), 42.1% suf-
fered from non-rotary vertigo. VM was more often observed with chronic migraine (CM) and topiramate had a good therapeutic effect, both on the incidence
of headache and on vertigo. There was also a positional character of vertigo with VM on DHI.
Conclusion: vertigo with VM has a mixed character, in the pathogenesis of which both central mechanisms in the form of central sensitization, and peripheral
ones, caused by activation of the trigemino-vascular system are involved. In most patients, vertigo with VM is positional. The article shows that anticonvulsant
topiramate is the drug of choice with proven effectiveness in migraine headaches.
