The article is addressed to specialists who use aminoglycoside antibiotics in their practice. The possibility of not only cochleotoxicity but also vestibulotoxi-
city (which are united by a general term ototoxicity) due to aminoglycoside treatment is discussed.
The article presents the current published data on the incidence of aminoglycosides-induced vestibulotoxicity, factors contributing to its development (such
as duration of use, patient age, concomitant diseases, especially kidney disease, hereditary predisposition). The article observes vestibular disorders in the
form of a long-lasting imbalance during movement and visual disturbances (oscilloscopy). It is emphasized that there is a general tendency in the whole world
to reduce the use of the most toxic preparations of this group - aminoglycosides of the first generation, such as streptomycin. 
The own observation of acute bilateral vestibulopathy due to the streptomycin treatment of infectious disease is analyzed. The results of the conducted
vestibulometric examination of the patient (routine tests and using videooculography – evaluation of spontaneous nystagmus, positional nystagmus, bither-
mal caloric test) are discussed. 
Once again the question is raised about the need for a balanced approach to aminoglycoside antibiotics therapy due to a significant decrease in the patient's
quality of life in case of complications in the auditory or vestibular system.    
Key words: aminoglycosides, vestibulotoxicity, vestibular dysfunction, bilateral vestibulopathy.
