Currently the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the basis of therapy for a number of diseases. It should be noted that the NSAID group in-
cludes lots of drugs with different chemical structure, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, tolerability and safety. Due to the fact that many NSAIDs have
comparable clinical efficacy, it is the drug safety profile and its tolerability that come first among the most significant characteristics of NSAIDs. This paper
presents the results of the largest clinical trials and meta-analyzes, in which the negative effect of NSAIDs on the digestive, cardiovascular and kidney
systems was studied. Also special attention is paid to the mechanism of development of adverse drug effects.
Key words: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, safety, cyclooxygenase, microsomal PGE 2 synthetase, gastro-toxicity, cardiotoxicity, oxicam, coxibes.
