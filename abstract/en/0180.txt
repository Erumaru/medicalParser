Allergic rhinitis (AR) — a widespread disease that significantly affects the quality of life. The issues of AR are considered taking into account 
the latest international and national conciliation documents. Emphasis is made on intranasal corticosteroids (ICS), which are recommended 
as the first line of therapy in the moderate and severe form of AR, as well as in the absence of therapy effects on the first stage of treatment. 
The mechanism of action, pharmacological peculiarities, therapeutic index of modern ICS are presented. The maximum therapeutic index 
showing the maximum efficacy and the minimum number of adverse events in the treatment of AR was revealed in the mometazone furoate (it 
is contained in the only domestic drug — nasal spray Nosefrin®). The data of the prospective open observational non-comparative study on 
the efficacy, tolerability and safety assessment of the nasal spray Nosefrin® in patients with seasonal AR (n=55) are described. Good clinical 
efficacy and safety of Russian nasal spray mometasone furoate Nozefrin® in monotherapy was established, confirmed both by objective data 
and subjective assessment of patients themselves.
