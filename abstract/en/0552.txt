Nowadays, there is a high prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disturbances, which determine the problem relevance. Despite the good 
prognosis, the life quality of people suffering from this pathology significantly reduces. Functional dyspepsia (PD) prevalence worldwide 
is  on  average  20–30%,  its  incidence  —  about  1%  per  year.  According  to  epidemiological  studies,  the  number  of  disability  days  per  year 
in  patients  with  PD  is  2–3  weeks  more  than  those  with  a  different  pathology,  which  emphasizes  the  social  significance  and  insufficient 
treatment effectiveness. Frequent visits to the doctor, multiple and often unjustified costly examinations, and ineffective treatment lead to 
economic losses. The article covers issues about etiology, risk factors, trend characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and treatment principles. It 
also discusses the syndrome of the digestive system’s most common functional diseases, the central nervous system role, psychosocial factors 
in the disease development in this group, and effective regimens.
Keywords: functional gastrointestinal disturbances, crossed syndrome, treatment, anxiolytics, aminophenyl-butyric acid.
