The review presents the main pathogenetic mechanisms of heartburn in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and modern approaches to its thera-
py. Heartburn is the main symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Mechanisms of its development are: pathological acid and non-acid reflux, esophageal
dysperistalsis, increased visceral hypersensitivity. Heartburn is the most common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
The elements of GERD pathogenesis are: violation of the antireflux barrier, slowing of the esophagus clearance, the presence of pathological acidic, slightly
acidic and slightly alkaline reflux, a decreased resistance of the esophageal mucosa to damaging agents, and increased visceral hypersensitivity.
PPIs are the drugs of choice in the treatment of GERD. Treatment of GERD should include a combination therapy, based on proton pump inhibitors in combi-
nation with adjuvant therapy, particularly antacid agents. The appointment of antacids in the complex treatment of GERD allows quickly to stop heartburn,
which significantly improves the quality of life of patients. Antacid preparations are effective in treating moderately expressed and rarely occurring symp-
toms, especially those associated with non-compliance with the recommended lifestyle.
Key words: heartburn, GERD, reflux, PPI, antacids.
