modern combined medicines is the syrup Evkabal, that contains liquid extracts of thyme and plantain.The positive effects of this drug were demonstrated in
several experimental and clinical studies. An officinal herbal medicine is currentlybecoming a matter of conscious choice due to its relative harmlessness,
gentleness of action, availability, and efficiency.
