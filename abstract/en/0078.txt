Nonspecific back pain is still one of the main causes of financial and economic costs in developed countries. International recommendations for the treatment
of this disease have been changed significantly over the past 30 years. A comprehensive personalized approach to treating a patient with the back pain re-
quires the selection of the most safe and inexpensive methods of prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. In this article, the treatment of acute, subacute and
chronic back pain is discussed in detail. In such patients the particular attention is given to analgesic therapy, ranging from the appointment of non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants and "symptom-modifying drugs of slow action" (Teraflex®), before the application of interventional
therapy.
Key words: nonspecific back pain, spondylarthrosis, facet syndrome, SI joint dysfunctions, minimally invasive treatment, interventional therapy.
