The paper discusses history taking and examination of patients with epilepsy. The authors highlight the aspects which can help with differential 
diagnosis. Errors and omissions in the beginning of diagnostic search may later result in incorrect interpreting of diagnostic data due to the 
initially wrong hypothesis. Unnecessary and non-informative instrumental tests should be avoided. Reduced history taking time can result in 
ignoring of paroxysmal event details which are of crucial importance for its correct interpreting. The questions should be simple, clear, without 
professional terms. Neurological examination is the key aspect in the clinical examination of epileptic patients. When examining a patient 
several minutes or hours after the seizure, particular attention should be paid to postictal phenomena, i.e., Todd’s paralysis or aphasia which 
contribute to the localization of epileptic focus. The aim of the examination long after the seizure is to identify permanent neurological deficit 
which indicates symptomatic epilepsy and/or acute brain injury. Clear neurological symptoms only are diagnostically relevant.
Keywords: epilepsy, diagnostics, anamnesis, examination, neurological deficit.
