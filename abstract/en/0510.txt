Aim: to study an effect of pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) on the clinical manifestations of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) 
in patients with compound pelvic varicose veins (PVV) and lower limb varicose vein disease (LEVVD).
Patients and Methods: an analysis of the study results of 95 patients with LEVVD and CVI of class C2, C3 according to CEAP 
was carried out. Of these, 65 women were diagnosed with PVV, accompanied by PCS. The patients were divided into three 
groups: the first (control) group included 30 patients with LEVVD without pathology of pelvic veins; the second — 35 patients 
with combined LEVVD and PVV, PCS. The third group consisted of patients with LEVVD and latent form of PVV. The severity of 
the most common and characteristic symptoms of LEVVD (pain and heaviness in the lower limbs and pelvis, edema of the lower 
limbs, varicose syndrome) was evaluated.
Results: the combination of LEVVD and PCS significantly increases the frequency and intensity of clinical manifestations 
of CVI. The severity of varicose syndrome prevailed in the second group (group 1 — 1 point; group 3 — 1.06±0.08 points; 
group 2 — 2.3±0.2 points, p=0.000001), pain in the lower limbs also significantly differed in patients of group 2 (group 1 — 
2.2±0.6 points; group 3 — 1.3±0.5 points; group 2 — 4.9±0.4 points; p=0.003). Pain, edema and severity in the lower limbs 
in patients of group 2 were found much more often in comparison with groups 1 and 3: pain in the lower limbs — 7 times; 
edema — 6 times, heaviness — 2 times.
Conclusion: PCS contributes to the deterioration of venous outflow from the lower limbs, exacerbates the clinical manifestations 
of CVI among patients with compound LEVVD and PCS.
Key words: lower limb and pelvis varicose disease, pelvic congestion syndrome, chronic venous insufficiency, venous pain, 
diagnosis.
