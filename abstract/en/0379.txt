Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the main cause of peptic ulcer and chronic gastritis, and a serious risk factor for complications in the upper gastrointesti-
nal tract caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Eradication of H. pylori is considered to be an important element of treatment and pre-
vention of NSAID-gastropathy.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the infection of H. pylori in patients with rheumatic diseases (RDs), the effect of this microorganism on the development
of NSAID- gastropathy and the possibility of its eradication by nifuratel.
Patients and methods: the urease test was used to assess the presence of H. pylori in patients who regularly took NSAIDs and underwent an endoscopic ex-
amination at the Clinic of Scientific Research Institute of Rheumatology named after V.A. Nasonovа for the period from 01.02.2017 to 31.03.2017 (2 months,
total sampling). A total of 109 patients, 72.5% of women and 27.5% of men with an average age of 53.5 ± 13.6 years were examined. The frequency of ero-
sions and gastric ulcers in patients with or without H. pylori was compared. After that, 32 patients infected with H. pylori with erosions, ulcers and / or ul-
cerative anamnesis received anti-Helicobacter therapy (omeprazole 20 mg + amoxicillin 1000 mg + nifuratel 400 mg 2 r. / day for 10 days). The achieve-
ment of eradication was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the feces  6 weeks after completion of the course of treatment.
Results: H. pylori was detected in 56% of the examined patients. In infected patients erosion and ulcers were detected significantly more often than in unin-
fected patients:  47,5% и 23,0% (OR 3,68; 95% Cl 1,56–8,68), р<0,001. The full course of eradication therapy was completed in 31 patients, in 1 patient the
treatment was interrupted due to the development of a skin allergic reaction. In other cases, no adverse events were noted. Eradication was achieved in 81,3%
of patients. In 4 patients, PCR appeared to be positive, and in 2 patients the result of treatment remained unknown.

Conclusion: most Russian patients with RDs are infected with H. pylori. The presence of H. pylori is associated with a greater incidence of NSAID-gas-
tropathy. Eradication therapy with nifuratel is effective and well tolerated.
Key words: H. pylori, NSAIDs, NSAID-gastropathy, eradication, nifuratel.
