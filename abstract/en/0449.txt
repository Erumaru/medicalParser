Rational therapy for the inflammatory disorders of external ear is of great importance for modern otorhinolaryngology. Annual increase in external otitis is
accounted for by the anatomy and physiology of external ear and reduced specific and non-specific resistance due to the adverse environmental changes.
Wide and uncontrolled use of antibiotics and antiseptics which resulted in resistant microbial strains provoking progressive and chronic course of external
otitis is another important factor of the development and recurrences of external ear inflammation. Modern recommendations for acute and chronic exter-
nal otitis require complex treatment which provides direct effect both on the causative agent and disease pathogenesis. Topical combinations meet these re-
quirements. Anauran (Zambon Italia S.r.l., Italy) is one of the topical combinations. Complex treatment of external otitis which includes Anauran provides
quick and safe clinical outcomes even in difficult and problematic cases (Pseudomonas aeruginosa).
Key words: external otitis, antibacterial therapy, resistance, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, treatment for external otitis, Anauran.
