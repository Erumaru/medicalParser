Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a complex of somatic and endocrine symptoms, quite common in women of reproductive age. This syndrome significantly
influences both operability and interpersonal relationships. Despite PMS is studied for a long time, diagnosis and treatment of this pathological condition are
currently a real therapeutic challenge. The paper reviews current data on PMS etiology, pathogenesis, diverse clinical symptoms, diagnosis and treatment
methods from neurologist's point of view. Main types of PMS clinical course are described. Due to high prevalence of pain, a particular algic form of PMS is
identified. Comorbid conditions are discussed. Special attention is paid to premenstrual (catamenial) migraine. Clinical efficacy of non-drug therapies (e.g.,
diet, physiotherapy, reflexology, exercises) and medication methods (including hormonal and non-hormonal approaches) are estimated. Social complexity
in finding an effective treatment plan and ways of compliance improvement in women with PMS are identified.
Key words: premenstrual syndrome, cephalgia, vegetative system dysfunction, hormonal therapy, non-drug methods.
