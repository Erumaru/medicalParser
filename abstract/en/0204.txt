At present, acid-dependent diseases (ADD) play the leading role in the structure of the adult population's appeal for the digestive system diseases. The ap-
pearance of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the pharmaceutical market has created a revolutionary breakthrough in the treatment of ADD. Preparations of
this group are most often prescribed. PPIs are the basic means in the treatment of ADD and an obligatory component of eradication therapy, they are also
used to treat NSAIDs-gastropathy. Many diseases require long-term acid-suppressive therapy, which raises the question of the safety of long-term admin-
istration of these drugs. The review presents current data on the possible adverse effects of prolonged therapy on various organs and systems that should be
taken into account when assigning IPP to patients: magnesium and B12 deficiency, hypergastrinemia, the risk of tumors growth, acute interstitial nephritis,
small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome, the risk of cardiovascular accidents, osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures, as well as an increased risk
in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The authors also describe preventive measures to reduce the risk of confirmed adverse effects of PPI.
Key words: acid-dependent diseases, proton pump inhibitors, acid suppression, adverse effects..
