At  present,  acute  intestinal  infections  (AII)  remain  a  significant  problem  in  the  clinic  of  infectious  diseases.  This  fact  is  due  to  the  high 
frequency of this pathology (which is the second after acute respiratory infections) with the complications likelihood, whereas for pediatric 
practice  —  with  the  fatal  case  risk.  The  article  shows  the  following  interrelated  key  pathogenic  mechanisms  of  gastrointestinal  lesion: 
dehydration syndrome (with increased gut permeability, increased secretion, inflammatory response development of the intestinal mucosa), 
microbiocenosis system destabilization and protective properties reduction of the mucin layer. All of them cause a symptom complex similar 
in various infectious lesions, e.g., fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and etc.
Oral rehydration is the basis of the AII pathogenetic treatment, the effectiveness of which is also reflected in the mortality rate decrease, 
considering the fact that the leading pathogenic link in AII is the dehydration syndrome development. One of the promising AII pathogenetic 
therapy areas is the search for drugs regulating intestinal secretion with no effect on its motility and adverse event’s absence in the central 
and peripheral nervous systems. A review and comparative analysis of the racecadotril antisecretory drug effectiveness is presented in 
the article.
