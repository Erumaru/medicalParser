In Russia, about 40 million cases of respiratory infections are registered every year, and it can be assumed that the actual 
number of people suffering from acute respiratory illness is much higher, and it is obvious that a significant number of patients 
seek medical help also with complaints of cough. In Russia, based on the results of a study carried out in Ryazan, 14.8% of 
respondents complained of a chronic cough.
Mucolytic therapy is the safest in the treatment of patients with productive cough. The most widely spread in clinical practice is 
acetylcysteine. The mucolytic effect of the drug is realized in the bronchi lumen and is based on the presence of sulfhydryl SH-
groups in its molecule, which break the disulfide bonds of mucopolysaccharides of sputum, making it less viscous. In addition, 
acetylcysteine has an antioxidant effect. Acetylcysteine has oral, parenteral and inhalation forms.
Depending on the etiology, pathogenesis and nature of the course of the disease, each type of cough requires appropriate therapy. 
In this case, the first stage in the treatment of productive cough comes protous therapy, including more modern and safe mucolytic 
drugs, a bright and reliable representative among which is acetylcysteine (ESPA-NAC®) in a convenient dosage form.
Key words: productive cough, respiratory infection, protous therapy, mucolytic therapy, acetylcysteine, ESPA-NAC®.
