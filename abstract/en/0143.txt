Recently a significant progress in understanding the mechanisms of airway inflammation has been observed. However main therapy for the vast majority of pa-
tients is still inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and as a rule long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA) in combined preparations, or other drugs depressing inflammation of
airways. Traditionally, anti-inflammatory therapy (ICS), as well as combined drugs with ICS, are prescribed in standard doses. Symptoms of bronchial asthma
(BA) can be additionally stopped with short-acting beta-2-agonists (on demand). In case of treatment failure the increase of ICS dose was recommended. After
achieving the effect and maintaining asthma control for at least 3 months, the dose can be. decreased (graded approach). However, LABA appearance with rapid
onset of action, particularly formoterol, led to creation of new regime of anti-inflammatory therapy, called SMART (Single Maintenance And Reliver Therapy).
The paper reviews recent clinical trials on effectiveness of SMART-treatment of asthma, including budesonide/formoterol in Symbicort Turbuhaler.
Key words: bronchial asthma, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-2-agonists, SMART, Symbicort, budesonide / formoterol.
