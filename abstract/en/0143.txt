In connection with the high resistance of microorganisms — pathogens of infectious diseases of the ENT organs to the antibacterial 
drugs most often used in outpatient and hospital clinical practice, it is important to study of the microbiota of patients with 
otogenic and rhinosinusogenic pyoinflammatory intracranial complications for improving the results of treatment at all stages 
of medical care. The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of 303 histories of patients with otogenous and rhinosinusogenic 
pyoinflammatory intracranial complications (PIC) and sepsis, who were treated in multi-profile hospitals in St. Petersburg, 
Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk, Kursk, Chelyabinsk for the period 2000-2014. Based on the results of culture studies, the authors have 
shown that when carrying out empirical antibacterial therapy, it is advisable to include carbapenems (meropenem, ertapenem, 
imipenem, doripenem, imipenem / cilastatin) or respiratory fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin (Levoleth ® R)) in the 
initial treatment schedule in combination with amikacin and metronidazole. The authors gave personal recommendations on the 
conduct of etiotropic antibiotic therapy of these nosologies.
Key words: ENT organs, intracranial complications, antibacterial therapy, fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin.
