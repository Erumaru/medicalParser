Urinary stone disease (USD) and urinary tract infections are the most common diseases in general urological practice. Typical examples of 
infected urinary stones are struvite stones with a prothetic infection. However, urolithiasis can also be combined with other pathogens and, 
thus, has a different chemical composition. Microbes may persist on the surface and inside urate concrements, which is not always reflected 
in the indicators of general and bacteriological culture of urine, causing a number of unforeseen difficulties in conservative therapy and 
surgical treatment of urolithiasis. The article describes the role of citrate therapy in infected nephrolithiasis, as well as the possibility of 
using fosfomycin trometamol in infections associated with urolithiasis and in the framework of antibiotic prophylaxis before endourological 
interventions. Preoperative and perioperative antibiotic therapy is mandatory for patients with signs of urinary tract infection, as it helps 
prevent the development of septic complications associated with surgical intervention.
