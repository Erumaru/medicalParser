Hageman’s disease is an extremely rare disorder of hemostasis, characterized by a significant decrease in the activity of plasma 
blood coagulation factor XII. The presented case reports the identification of rare Hageman disease in the woman of 58 years 
old  with  cardiac  pathology.  The  patient  repeatedly  admitted  to  the  cardiology  department  for  treatment  of  ischemic  heart 
disease, arterial hypertension. During one of the visits, an elongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was 
revealed, which was the cause for further follow-up. Conducting the examination in the conditions of the hematological scientific 
center revealed a rare pathology of coagulation — Hageman’s disease, based on the absence of factor XII in the coagulogram, 
prolongation of the APTT and retardation of fibrinolysis. The feature of this case is that the disease has been asymptomatic for 
a long time, aggravating the course of cardiovascular pathology. Particularly interesting is the fact that the patient was found 
to have a complete absence of blood coagulation factor XII, whereas in previously published observations only the deficiency of 
this factor was described.
Key words: rare case, Hageman’s disease, absence of factor XII, coagulating blood system, hemostasis, coagulogram, APTT.
