Acid-related diseases (ARD), of course, are the actual problem of modern gastroentorology. The hydrochloric acid produced by the parietal cells of the stom-
achplays a significant role in the pathogenesis of this group of diseases. The symptoms of ARD, dominated by heartburn, regurgitation and epigastric pain
have a marked negative impact on patients' quality of life and lead to significant financial costs.The basic approach to the treatment of these pathologies is
to effect the production of hydrochloric acid by the parietal cells and/or binding of acid in the lumen of the stomach.Currently, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
are the primary agents for the treatment of acid-related diseases.Despite the fact that antacids are inferior to PPIS in the expression of acid-suppressive ac-
tivity, in some situations they are preferable. The review is devoted to the advantages of antacid drugs, in particular the speed of their actions, the impact on
non-acidic duodenal and gastro-oesophageal refluxes.Special attention is paid to the clinical application of the combined drug containing calcium carbon-
ate and magnesium carbonate (Rennie®).
Key words: acid-related disease, GERD, antacids, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, on-demand therapy, non-acidic refluxes, acid pocket.
