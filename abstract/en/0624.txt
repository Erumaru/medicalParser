Summary
The paper presents a series of recent cases of successful removal of foreign bodies of the larynx and laryngopharynx in younger children. These clinical cas-
es are characterized by a number of features. Thus, even large foreign bodies can be removed without tracheostomy (case № 2 and case № 3). Hence, these
children did not require hospital admission. The latter is particularly important in the context of medical economic aspect. In the first two cases, foreign bod-
ies were removed by hypopharyngoscopy.In case #3, the nature of the foreign body (large metallic tin soldier) was of interest, i.e., its irregular shape and lo-
calization in the larynx as well as transportation of the child to the hospital since the mode of carriage and the position of the child were contrary to stan-
dard recommendations. In clinical case #2 and clinical case #3, the larynx was not damaged despite the localization of foreign bodies, their irregular shape
and large size. If occurred, these damages could affect vocal function of the larynx. Foreign body removal was performed without anesthesia in all children.
Key words: laryngeal foreign body, hypopharyngoscopy, direct laryngoscopy.
