High prevalence of low back pain (predominantly, lumbar backache) resulting from herniated discs requires careful study of the pathogenesis 
of  this  disorder  to  improve  preventive  and  therapeutic  interventions.  Lumbar  disc  herniation  is  associated  with  inflammation.  Currently, 
inflammation is considered to be associated with unfavorable symptoms resulting from nerve ending stimulation which leads to pain. However, 
inflammation is also regarded as one of the key factors of the regression of lumbar disc herniation. The paper discusses molecular and cellular 
mechanisms involved in the regression of lumbar disc herniation including matrix remodeling and neovascularization. Inflammatory response 
in lumbar disc herniation and, in particular, the role of monocytes and macrophages are highlighted. Investigation of cytokine and immune 
cell contribution to intervertebral disc degeneration, inflammation, and nociception may provide potential therapeutic targets in patients with 
symptomatic disc herniation. As a result, their quality of life will be improved.
Keywords: lumbar disc herniation, intervertebral disc, inflammation, macrophages, monocytes.
