Intestinal microbiota is a complex formed by a large number of microorganisms, which make a kind of symbiosis with the human 
body, where everyone gets benefits for his existence and influences the partner. It can be confidently said, that there are no such 
functions of the body, which are not effected by the intestinal microbiota in one way or another.
The intestine is the largest immune organ of the human body, while the effectiveness of local immunity depends on the colonization 
of the intestine by an indigenous microflora. Lactobacilli take a special place in the process of formation and functioning of the 
immune system.
The aim of this review was to provide the most complete information about the composition and functions of the intestinal 
microbiota, its role in the formation of immunity and the therapeutic possibilities of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The established 
mechanisms of molecular action, the detailed structural and genetic characteristics, the data of randomized studies and meta-
analyzes, and the great experience of effective practical use of LGG make this strain the means of choice for the prevention and 
relieving a number of conditions caused by immune system dysfunction.
Key words: intestinal microflora, immunity, probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, LGG.
