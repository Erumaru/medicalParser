Aim:  to  study  the  sensitization  spectrum  using  comprehensive  allergological  diagnosis  in  children  with  persistent  food  allergy,  who  had 
experienced anaphylaxis episodes.
Patients  and  Methods:  14  children  (11  (79%)  boys  and  3  (21%)  girls)  who  experienced  one  or  more  food  anaphylaxis  episodes  in  early 
childhood and have persistent food allergy during the study (mean age — 6.8 years) underwent dynamic follow-up. The following allergic 
etiologies to severe life-threatening reactions were revealed: in 6 (43%) patients there were dairy products, in another 6 (43%) children — 
eggs, in 3 (21%) patients — kiwi, 2 (14%) patients had a reaction to fish, peanuts, sesame, and 1 (7%) — to walnuts and shrimps. All patients 
underwent a comprehensive allergological diagnosis, including the ImmunoCAP ISAC test.
Results: during the study, all children (100%) were confirmed with the true food allergy causing the anaphylactic reactions in history and the 
remaining etiologies of persistent food allergy at the present time. Sensitization to the major specific components of inhaled allergens was 
detected in all 14 children (100%) who experienced the food anaphylaxis. The highest hypersensitivity was observed to birch (rBet v1) — from 
0.3 to 100.0 ISU-E (79%), to cypress (nCup a1) — from 0.3 to 1.2 ISU-E (36%), to cats (rFel d1) — from 1.6 to 90.0 ISU-E (64%), and to dogs 
(rCan f1) — from 1.1 to 40.0 ISU-E (50%). None of the patients showed sensitization to house dust mite molecules.
Conclusion: as a result of the study, the data were obtained on the sensitization formation to respiratory allergens in all children (100%) who 
experienced food anaphylaxis and who have persistent food allergy at the present time.
