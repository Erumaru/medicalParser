Aim: to determine clinical diagnostic and predictive value of serum IL-22 levels in children with atopic dermatitis.
Patients and Methods: the study enrolled 95 children with atopic dermatitis. Mild atopic dermatitis was diagnosed in 22 children, moderate in 
43 children, and severe in 30 children. Control group included 20 healthy children. Immunological examination (total and specific serum Ig E 
levels) and blood biochemistry were performed in a total of 95 children. Serum IL-22 level was measured by ELISA.
Results: significantly increased IL-22 levels were revealed in atopic dermatitis children as compared with the controls (median 175.2 pg/mL 
[158.9; 221.5] and 28.7 [25.6; 313] pg/mL, respectively; р=0.039). Strong direct correlation between IL-22 levels and SCORAD (scoring 
of  atopic  dermatitis)  index  was  found  (RS=0.774;  р<0.05).  The  analysis  of  IL-22  levels  has  demonstrated  that  IL-22  median  is  196.2 
[145.1; 201.2] pg/mL in 80 children with atopic dermatitis and IgE overproduction and 173.9 [151.4; 316.2] pg/mL in 15 children with 
atopic dermatitis and normal IgE levels (p=0.197). Week correlation between total IgE and IL-22 levels was revealed in atopic dermatitis 
(RS=0.307; р<0.05).
Conclusion: considering increased serum IL-22 levels in a total of 95 children with atopic dermatitis and tendency to increased IL-22 leves 
along with the growing severity of dermatitis, IL-22 should be regarded as a predictive marker of dermatitis.
