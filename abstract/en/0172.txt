Pain in the neck (PN) is a widely-spread phenomenon, and it is experienced at least once in life in about 2/3 of population. Degenerative diseases of the ver-
tebra – ostearthrosis and osteochondrosis are considered to be the main causes of PN, and their prevalence grows with age. The sources of such pains are
intervertebral discs and joints, as well as ligaments of the spine and muscles of the back. In osteochondrosis, osteophytes compress the nerve roots of the
spine (radiculopathy) and the spine itself (myelopathy). The differential diagnosis is aimed primarily at exclusion of the symptomatic pains, which can be
caused by severe somatic pathology, immune disorders, infections and tumors. Usually PN can be stopped by conservative treatments, but relapses are fre-
quent. Complex approach is used most frequently, including non-pharmacological methods (orthopedics, exercises, physiotherapy, etc.) and medicines. Non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used most widely to terminate acute pain in degenerative diseases of the musculoskeletal apparatus. In the
majority of cases it is most reasonable to use selective NSAIDs, such as Nimesulide (Nise®), taking into consideration high effectiveness backed by low risk
of side effects.
Key words: pain in the neck, acute torticollis, degenerative diseases of the vertebra, osteochondrosis, osteoarthrosis, therapy of pains, nimesulide, non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
