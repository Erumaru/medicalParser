The article presents the possibilities of proton therapy as a new method of treating malignant tumors, which has certain advantages over standard photon
radiation therapy. This is due to the possibility of creating the maximum dose of radiation in the target area without exceeding the tolerated dosages for nor-
mal tissues, even if the target is close to the critical structures of the body. A higher dose leads, respectively, to a greater probability of death of cancer cells.
Currently, there is an active accumulation of experience in the clinical use of proton therapy. The presented studies show the potential advantage of proton
therapy in the treatment of CNS tumors, chord and chondrosarcoma of the skull and skeleton base, head and neck tumors, malignant tumors in children. The
role of protons in cancer of the rectum, stomach, prostate, pancreas is actively studied. The results obtained should help to identify groups of patients for
whom proton therapy will be crucial in improving disease control, overall survival and maintaining quality of life.
Key words: proton therapy, chordoma, chondrosarcoma, malignant tumors in children, radioinduced tumors.
