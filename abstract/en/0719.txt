Considering common use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) both in inpatient and outpatient departments, it is important to analyze their
major effects as well as adverse side effects and current approaches to their prevention. Novel non-selective NSAID, amtolmetin guacil, has anti-inflamma-
tory, analgesic, antipyretic, and desensitizing effects, acts on thalamic pain centers, and increases pain threshold. However, the key intrinsic advantage of
this medication is nitric oxide(NO)-associated gastroprotective effect. This safe and effective analgesic is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with therapeu-
tic potential both to reduce acute pain and to treat chronic rheumatic disorders. Gastroprotective properties of amtolmetin guacil are provided by several
mechanisms. The key mechanism is increased gastric mucosal NO synthesis.  Amtolmetin guacil indirectly decreases hydrochloric acid production and pro-
motes epithelial cell reparation. The paper addressess the results of clinical trials (including comparison with other NSAIDs) which demonstrate efficacy, safe-
ty, and better tolerance of amtolmetin guacil.
Key words: NSAID, anti-inflammatory properties, analgesics, pain, nimesulide, amtolmetin guacil, efficacy, safety, Niselat.
