The high incidence of acute respiratory diseases (ARD) in children, relapses and reinfections, which form the category 
of  frequently  ill  children  (FIC)  with  long-lasting  symptoms  and  complications,  the  possibility  of  deaths,  especially 
in children of the first 3 years of life, make the timely diagnosis and rational therapy one of the most relevant problem 
in pediatric practice.
The  highest  incidence  of  ARD  is  observed  in  pre-school  children  attending  organized  groups.  The  list  of  effective  and  safe 
chemotherapeutic agents of etiotropic therapy for ARVI in children is very limited. The following direct antiviral agents are used 
in children: from the age of 1 year — oseltamyvir (recommended by WHO for severe and moderate forms of influenza), from 
2 years — umifenovir (for mild and moderate forms of influenza and other acute respiratory viral infections), from 3 years — 
inosine  pranobex  (Isoprinosine).  The  most  promising  direction  in  the  treatment  of  FIC  is  the  prevention  of  polypharmacy, 
i. e. prescription the drug, which combines both antiviral and immunotropic effects, e. g., inosine pranobex.
Key words: inosine pranobex, isoprinosine, acute respiratory viral infections, antiviral therapy, frequently ill children.
