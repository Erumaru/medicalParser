Otosclerosis is a hereditary disease with autosomal dominant type of inheritance, with the morphological substrate formed by a limited osteodystrophic
process, in which the bone resorption take place in the bone capsules of both labyrinths under the influence of osteoclasts (otospiensis) and its neoplasm (oto-
sclerosis). The disease is characterized by hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo. The main diagnostic criteria of otosclerosis are the bilateral conductive hearing
loss, a normal tympanic membrane, a good patency of the auditory tube, the family history. There are tympanic, cochlear and mixed forms of the disease.
The tympanometry, acoustic reflexometry, computer tomography are used for diagnostics. Differential diagnostics is performed with the pathology of the
middle ear (exudative otitis media, consequences of transferred purulent otitis, rupture of the auditory ossicle, fixation of the malleus (anvil), congenital mal-
formations of the middle ear); hydrodynamic abnormalities of the labyrinth (perilymphatic fistula, Minor's syndrome, the syndrome of an enlarged aqueduct
of the vestibule) and congenital syndromes.
Key words: otospongiosis, otosclerosis, hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo.
