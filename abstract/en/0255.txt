The article presents summarized data about the clinical course of the most common diseases accompanied by vestibular dizziness, the 
principles of diagnosis, and differential diagnosis. Establishing the causes of vertigo is fundamentally important, as it provides a real 
opportunity to carry out pathogenetically substantiated treatment and to select adequate preventive tactics. Currently, antiemetics 
and vestibular suppressants are used for the management of an acute attack of vestibular vertigo, but the use of these drugs is limited 
to several days, since they slow down the formation of compensatory mechanisms in acute peripheral injury of the vestibular analyzer. 
The main groups of medicines used for the treatment of acute dizziness are anticholinergic, antihistamines, antidopaminergic drugs and 
benzodiazepines. The results of scientific research, including randomized clinical trials, non-interventional studies (reproducing the 
scheme of a daily work with the patients), and meta-analysis in this article confirm the effectiveness of the clinical use of Vertigoheel® 
for treating dizziness. The efficacy of Vertigoheel® for treating vertigo is comparable to that of dimenhydrinate.
Key words: dizziness, vertigo, acute vestibular syndrome, acute peripheral vestibular syndrome, central vestibular dizziness, 
Meniere’s disease, vestibular migraine, Vertigoheel®.
