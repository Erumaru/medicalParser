Conservative treatment of acute and chronic hemorrhoids is a relevant issue of growing importance due to its high occurrence and high rate of primary care
visits as well as the development of effective analgesic, thrombolytic, haemostatic, and phlebotonic medications. Conservative treatment should be complex
and include both systemic and topical agents. Among topical drugs, series medicine Relief is of special interest. There are several preparations which make
them comfortable in use for acute and chronic hemorrhoids. Relief is prescribed for bleeding hemorrhoids, Relief Advance reduces pain, and Relief Ultra is
used for thrombosed hemorrhoid and inflammation. Significant wound-healing effect allows to use these medications postoperatively. The paper addresses
the experience with Relief in various patient groups.
Key words: hemorrhoids, thrombosis, bleeding, conservative treatment.
