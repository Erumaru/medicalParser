The prevalence of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) - clinico-morphological variants of liver damage caused by medication intake - reaches 5-20% in differ-
ent countries, which according to some data corresponds to 10% of all adverse reactions of the human body associated with the use of medications. This
article examines in detail the predictors of DILI, the pathogenesis of primary, genetically-dependent and toxic drug reactions, clinico-morphological forms
of DILI, the algorithm of medical care depending on the type of side effect. The drugs of the first choice for the DILI treatment are hepatoprotectors, which
increase the ability of hepatocytes to resist toxic effects, withstand the development and progression of chronic inflammation in the liver, and inhibit the
development of liver fibrosis. The publication reflects the properties of standardized silymarin, Legalon®, which is approved by international agencies - the
FDA and EMEA in the US and Europe. The effectiveness of the use of silymarin for the prevention of DILI has been demonstrated in a number of experimen-
tal and clinical studies for patients receiving anti-tuberculosis, cytostatic therapy, as well as drugs for the control of Alzheimer's disease. The main mecha-
nisms of hepatoprotective action of silymarin are antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, regenerative, membrane-stabilizing and antifibrotic.
Key words: drug-induced liver injury, side effect, silymarin, Legalon®, antioxidant.
