Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) is a common chronic complication of diabetes mellitus that significantly affects patients’ well-being, quality
of life and functioning. This lecture deals with practical issues of clinical diagnosis of PDPN and the algorithm for differential diagnosis of the pain syndrome
in the lower extremities in diabetic patients. Based on the major pathophysiological pathways in PDPN, the author presents the rationale for the use of symp-
tomatic centrally-acting drugs to diminish pain, such as anticonvulsants, antidepressants and opioid analgesics, with description of each class of the drugs
used for the treatment of PDPN, evidenced-based data on their efficacy, tolerability and contraindications, as well as the potential of combination therapy.
Their dosage regimens and potential pitfalls with the use of various pharmaceutical groups are described. The agents are categorized into the 1st, 2nd and
3rd line treatments in accordance with several international clinical guidelines. The necessity is emphasized to tailor the choice of the drug supported by the
evidence-based data, concomitant medications, tolerability, costs and patient’s preferences, as well as patient’s age and concomitant illnesses. 
Key words: diabetes mellitus, painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, treatment.
