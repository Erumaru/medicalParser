Currently, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a global problem, which is associated with the prevalence of the disease and high mortali-
ty. The main cause of the death of patients with COPD is the progression of the disease. In 2016-2017 years there were a number of major authoritative meet-
ings, where the therapeutic options of the treatment of patients with COPD were discussed, taking into account the phenotypes, the need of prevention of exac-
erbations, as well as the features of inhalation therapy. Despite the fact that the inhaled long-acting bronchodilators take the first place in the treatment of COPD
patients, the aim of the authors was to draw the reader's attention to the therapy with fixed combinations of inhaled glucocorticosteroids (ICS) / long-acting β2-
agonists (LABA), emphasizing the priority of the extra-fine particles aerosols in COPD, and a combination of ICS / LABA together with long-acting anticholiner-
gics (LAMA). Recommendations and clinical observations of the treatment of this nosology are given, as well as results of comparative studies of efficacy and
safety of the triple combination  ICS / LABA / LAMA versus other COPD therapies presented.
Key words: COPD, inhalation therapy, recommendations, inhaled glucocorticosteroids, long-acting β2-agonists, extra-fine-particles aerosols.
