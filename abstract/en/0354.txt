The development and marketing authorization of a medicinal product must follow the principles of evidence-based medicine 
at all stages of pharmaceutical and clinical development. These principles are supported both at the scientific and regulatory 
level in order to bring to the market drugs with proven effectiveness and safety. The introduction of the Federal Law No. 61-FZ 
in 2010 tightened the requirements for providing the drug evidence base. Since May 6, 2017, the Eurasian Economic Union 
has introduced the unified rules for the development and marketing authorization of drugs, as an adaptation of the rules of the 
European Union. This, on the one hand, imposes strict rules on the manufacturer concerning preclinical and clinical trials of 
medicines, and on the other hand, it substantially increases the guarantees of introducing high-quality drugs to the domestic 
market.
There are different approaches to conducting clinical trials of original and generic drugs. The article describes the features of 
research programs of original diabetes drugs based on small molecules and biological preparations, as well as generics and 
biosimilars.
Key words: diabetes mellitus, generics, biosimilars, clinical trials, evidence-based medicine.
