The paper discusses current views on dermatoses of complex etiology. The role of pathogenic microflora and, in particular, Staphylococcus aureus, in infec-
tious sensitization and immune-mediated inflammation is highlighted as these factors significantly reduce the efficacy of topical steroids. The benefit from
applying topical corticosteroids combined with other active ingredients which act against the whole spectrum of pathogenic microbes and have powerful an-
ti-inflammatory effect is demonstrated. These drugs are especially useful in outpatient treatment since patients with allergic dermatoses visit a doctor at day
5-7 of acute period when complications have already occurred. Combined topical corticosteroids rapidly suppress infectious process and help to overcome
steroid resistance induced by Staphylococcus aureus superantigens and other pathogens. We present our long-term successful experience with Triderm cream
used for acute and chronic dermatoses in combination with bacterial fungal infections. The results of Russian and international clinical trials demonstrate
therapeutic efficacy and safety of Triderm.
Key words: dermatoses of complex etiology, Staphylococcus aureus, skin dysbiosis, microbial sensitization, combined topical therapy, betamethasone dipro-
pionate + gentamycin + clotrimazole.
