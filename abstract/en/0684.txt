The presented clinical observation characterizes a rare clinical case of an aneurysm of the portal vein in a young woman, first clinically manifested during
pregnancy, under the guise of decompensated liver cirrhosis, which was excluded by the results of liver needle core biopsy. The disease started with coffee-
grounds vomiting, which happened on the 7th week of pregnancy. The examination  revealed a splenomegaly (70 cm2), an aneurysm of the portal vein, and
a cavernous transformation of the portal vein. Despite the satisfactory state of health on the background of conservative treatment, according to the results
of ultrasound, there was a negative dynamics - expansion of the portal vein to 30 mm, according to the results of fibrogastroduodenoscopy - esophageal
varices of the Ш degree, gastric varices of the I-II degree, signs of portal gastropathy. In April 2014, taking into account the negative dynamics, the patient
was sent for surgical treatment to the State Scientific Center of the Federal Medical Biophysical Center named after A.I. Burnazyan (Moscow), where the fol-
low-up study revealed an aneurysm of the portal vein with a rare feature - compression of  hepaticocholedochus, formation of a hepatoportal block and de-
velopment of cavernous transformation of segmental branches of the portal vein, which required a high-tech surgical treatment.
Key words: clinical case, an aneurysm of the portal vein, young age.
