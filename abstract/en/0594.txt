Baby colics are the most common cause of the parents’ appeals to pediatricians in the first year of a child’s life. In most cases, 
colic appear on the 2–4th week of the baby’s life and ends by the end of the 4–5th month. The article presents basic information 
about the pathogenesis of baby colic. It emphasizes the influence of various factors characteristic of children in the first months 
of life: the immaturity of the digestive and nervous systems, as well as the instability and imbalance of micro-flora as the 
cause of their development. In some children, the predominant cause of colic is improper feeding with fast sucking, aerophagia, 
overfeeding, forcible feeding or incorrect dilution of the formula. Questions of diagnostics and differential diagnostics with 
careful exception of organic pathology requiring special therapy or surgical interventions are considered. The possible methods 
of treatment and the reasons for the frequent ineffectiveness of various therapeutic approaches are described. The indications 
for the appointment of simethicone (Bobotic) in drops as an effective drug of the first choice for stopping infant colic, regardless 
of the prevailing link of pathogenesis, are justified.
Key words: meteorism, infant, colic, simethicone, Bobotic.
