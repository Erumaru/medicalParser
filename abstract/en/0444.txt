The paper discusses the role of intranasal steroids as a basic therapy for allergic rhinitis (AR) and rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Mometasone furoate, top-
ical corticosteroid, is characterized by several advantages, i.e., the most broad range of indications, high efficacy, very low bioavailability, and long-term clin-
ical experience. Among modern intranasal corticosteroids, Nozefrin® with its high affinity and selective effects on corticosteroid receptors is of great inter-
est. Nozefrin® is a domestic corticosteroid for intranasal use. Mometasone furoate, the active ingredient of Nozefrin®, is one of the most common corticos-
teroids with established efficacy and safety and minimal bioavailability. Nozefrin® is the first mometasone furoate-containing nasal spray manufactured in
Russia.
Mometasone furoate is used in AR treatment and is a standard for rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. This agent is employed in children over 2 years. Noze-
frin® significantly reduces nasal symptoms of intermittent and perennial AR. Nozefrin® equals foreign intranasal anti-inflammatory agents and can be rec-
ommended for inflammatory diseases of the nose and paranasal sinuses.
Key words: corticosteroids, intranasal corticosteroids, allergic rhinitis, mometasone furoate, rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.
