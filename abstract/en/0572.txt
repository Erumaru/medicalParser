Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a functional gastrointestinal disorder, is one of the most common conditions in developed countries. Its symptoms significantly
reduce the quality of life. Great attention is paid to this functional disease worldwide.
Currently, abnormal intestinal bacterial colonization, small intestinal overgrowth syndrome, and unhealthy diet (fast food, fried food, irritants etc.) are con-
sidered key pathophysiological mechanisms. A dysregulated gut-brain axis which results in enteric nervous system abnormalities and visceral hypersensitivity
also has an important role in the pathogenesis. Recently, it was demonstrated that mast cells release various mediators of inflammation which increase in-
testinal permeability.
Novel data on IBS pathogenesis laid the foundation for the development of innovative and perspective rational treatment modalities. The paper describes in
details IBS pharmacotherapy depending on the subtype (constipation-predominant or diarrhea-predominant) and addresses the role of probiotics, herbal
therapy, and alternative medicine.
Key words: irritable bowel syndrome, pathogenic therapy.
