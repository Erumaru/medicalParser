Acute tonsillopharyngitis is a general term used to describe any acute inflammation of the mucous membrane and oropharynx 
lymphoid formations. Administration of topical drugs (mouthwashes, sprays, lozenges) is the main treatment method for most 
patients with inflammatory pathology and streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis. Most often, local dosage forms are represented by 
a combination of various drugs, which helps them to quickly and effectively interact on the main manifestations of the disease.
The article highlights the possibility of using local antibacterial and antiseptic drugs for the topical treatment of acute tonsil­
lopharyngitis. Data are given on the use of the drug Grammidin®, based on a local broad­spectrum antibiotic gramicidin S and 
antiseptic cetylpyridinium chloride. The drug showed high efficacy and safety of use in adults and children, due to the combi­
nation of active substances and their synergism. The strength of the drug Grammidin® is in its effectiveness against microbial 
associations — biofilms, which is confirmed, in particular, with data on the use of the drug in patients with exacerbation of 
chronic infectious­inflammatory diseases of the oropharynx. Grammidin® in the pharmaceutical form of «metered dose spray» 
provides additional benefits in the treatment of patients with infectious and inflammatory diseases of the pharynx.
Key  words:  acute  tonsillopharyngitis,  microbial  associations,  metered  dose  spray,  gramicidin  S,  cetylpyridinium  chloride, 
Grammidin®.
