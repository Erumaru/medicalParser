The importance of accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement can not be overestimated. Both under- and overestimation can have non-favorable conse-
quences. If BP is underestimated, the patient does not receive appropriate treatment, which can prevent serious complications in the future. If BP is overes-
timated the patient will be prescribed unnecessary drugs that drop normal BP . So ordinary and simple action like BP measurement  is  very important. The
paper presents  BP measurement rules, the pros and cons of home measurement, describes in detail BP measurement technique, and focuses on the most com-
mon errors of both patients and doctors. The need to have a device for accurate and  simple BP measurement, available for non-professionals and not  re-
quiring extensive training, served as an stimulus for the development of automatic and semi-automatic electronic BP monitors. Examples of such devices are
new electronic tonometers  by company OMRON. There are various models that are really well suited for non-professionals, and  professionals, combining
ease of use of automatic tonometer and  accuracy of measuring, typical for mechanical one.
Key words: blood pressure, blood pressure measurement, errors blood pressure measurement, rules of blood pressure measurement, tonometer, automatic
