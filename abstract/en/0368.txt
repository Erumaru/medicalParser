Pain syndromes of soft tissues are the most frequent reason for contacting a general practitioner. According to modern ideas, pain syndromes of soft tissues
are divided into local, regional and generalized. Regional pain syndromes include myofascial syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome, characterized
by severe pain and difficulty in diagnosis. The article presents the main approaches to diagnosis and treatment of myofascial syndrome - a kind of regional
soft tissue syndrome in general therapeutic practice. Myofascial syndrome is characterized by muscular dysfunction and the formation of local muscular
densities in the affected muscles. There are primary and secondary myofascial syndromes. The primary myofascial syndrome is caused by an overload
and/or the muscle damage. Most often, painful changes are experienced in muscles that are predominantly tonic and regulate the statokinetic function: the
muscle that lifts the scapula, the trapezius muscle, the square muscle of the waist, the pear-shaped muscle. Secondary myofascial syndrome develops on the
background of rheumatic and endocrine diseases, pathology of the spine, in visceral pain syndromes. The article considers the questions of differential diag-
nosis of myofascial syndrome with fibromyalgia, rheumatic polymyalgia, and modern approaches to the management of patients.
