Gout, a well-known disease, is still an important issue in terms of differential diagnosis and treatment approach. Hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor
of cardiorenal continuum, a comorbidity which makes difficulties for the management approach and requires both various specialists and multicomponent
treatment. This clinical case demonstrates that gout does not always manifest with arthritis at onset thus requiring careful differential diagnosis and treat-
ment approach. The paper describes in detail EULAR recommendations (2014) for gout diagnosis and treatment. The importance of renal function assessment
is highlighted since hyperuricemia is one of the risk factors for renal failure. In addition, cardiovascular risk factors associated with high cardiovascular
mortality in goat are commonly revealed in these patients. In a patient with prior gastrointestinal disorder, amtolmetin guacil/Niselat was the drug of choice
for arthritis. This agent is characterized by better cardiovascular safety as compared with other NSAIDs.
Key words: gout, acute gout attack, hyperuricemia.
