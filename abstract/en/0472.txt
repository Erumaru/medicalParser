General  anesthetics  are  one  of  the  greatest  medical  discoveries,  allowing  to  carry  out  diagnostic  procedures  and  surgical 
interventions  even  in  the  very  young  patients,  reducing  the  adverse  effects  of  hemodynamic  reactions  in  response  to  pain 
and stress stimulation. However, there are data on the ability of anesthetics to have a neurotoxic effect on the brain. Studies 
conducted  on  animals  have  shown  a  negative  effect  of  general  anesthetics  on  the  developing  brain,  causing  a  widespread 
apoptotic neurodegeneration, impaired synaptogenesis and persistent memory and learning deficits. The clinical data, which 
testify  to  the  development  of  postoperative  cognitive  dysfunction  and  the  long-term  learning  disabilities  in  the  pediatric 
population, remain conflicting. One of the main aims of the research in children is to determine the effect of anesthesia on 
cognitive function in early and delayed periods. The review presents data on the pathogenetic mechanisms of the effect of 
general anesthesia on the developing brain, occurring of delayed cognitive deficits in children, and possible approaches to their 
drug and non-drug prevention.
Key words: postoperative cognitive dysfunction, general anaesthesia, children, neuroprotection, hopantenic acid, Pantogam.
