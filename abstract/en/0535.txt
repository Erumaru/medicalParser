Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disease in which neuropathies often develop. The frequency of neuropathy among patients with diabetes, depending on the
method of their detection, varies from 25% to 90%. This article presents the clinical classification of asymmetric diabetic neuropathies (DNP). Cranial neu-
ropathies (CNR) are considered in detail. Literature data on the prevalence of CNR with lesions of the third, fourth, sixth and seventh cranial nerves are pre-
sented. A clinical picture of cranial diabetic neuropathies with the lesion of certain oculomotor nerves is described both in isolation and in combination. Data
on the clinical course of diabetic ophthalmoplegia are presented. Particular attention is paid to the main types of treatment: control of glycemia, pathogenetic
therapy, the use of symptomatic drugs in the presence of pain syndrome. The possibilities of pathogenetic therapy of diabetic neuropathies and the place of
preparations containing B vitamins in the treatment of this pathology are considered in detail. Group B vitamins have a wide spectrum of pharmacodynamics
properties and are involved as coenzyme forms in most metabolic processes. The variant of application of complex preparations of group B vitamins in DNP
treatment is considered.
Key words: diabetes mellitus, cranial neuropathy, B vitamins.
