Cancer incidence and mortality are higher among diabetics. Growing evidences demonstrate associations between diabetes and cancer. Diabetics have
greater risk of various types of cancer. The most strong associations are between diabetes and pancreatic cancer. In addition, diabetics have higher risks of
breast, uterine, bladder, and renal cancer. Pathophysiological mechanisms of the association between diabetes and cancer are insulin resistance and hyper-
insulinemia, chronic systemic inflammation and high blood glucose. Insulin is a growth factor that promotes cell proliferation. Mitogenic effect of hyperin-
sulinemia is the most significant in malignant cells which frequently overexpress insulin receptors. Hyperglycemia provides malignant cells with the energy
for proliferation and promotes cancer growth and angiogenesis. Additionally, there is an association between cancer risk and diabetic medications. Some
medications decrease cancer risk while others may increase it. Metformin is associated with reduced incidence and mortality from some cancers.
Key words: diabetes, insulin, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, cancer.
