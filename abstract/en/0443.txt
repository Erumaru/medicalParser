The paper discusses specific features of infectious diseases in patients with upper respiratory tract (UPT) disorders. It was demonstrated that UPT micro-
biomes have a dual role. First, they have positive effects on host ecosystem. Second, they colonize UPT mucosa with various microbes for a long time. In the
course of colonization, microorganisms invade the host, cooperate and interact with the host, compete, and adapt to environmental factors. As a result of long-
term adaptation, certain bacteria are able to form biofilms. These bacteria while being integrated into the biological community are characterized by very high
(50-500-fold) antibacterial resistance. Pneumococci and P. aeruginosa form biofilms in chronic sinusitis and otitis, beta-hemolytic Streptococci form biofilms
in chronic tonsillitis. Currently, it is generally accepted that biofilms are responsible for ineffective antibacterial therapy for pyogenic inflammatory condi-
tions in a number of patients. The authors recommend macrolides, i.e., roxithromycin, for acute UPT infections.
Key words: acute infections, upper respiratory tract, macrolides, roxithromycin , biofilms, bacterial colony, microbiome, resistance, antibacterial therapy.
