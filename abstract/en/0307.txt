Psoriasis is a multifactorial disease, which is manifested not only by skin changes, but also by the vascular system changes. 
Due to this, there is often a comorbidity of psoriasis with cardiovascular diseases, and in patients with severe forms of psori­
asis, there is an increase in the level of a number of cytokines, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelin­1, etc. 
This, in turn, provokes the development of pathological angiogenesis. Many foreign studies have demonstrated the relationship 
of an inflammatory process in psoriasis and the inflammatory process in the vascular wall, which is a sufficient justification 
for the inclusion of phlebotropic drugs in the comprehensive therapy. In dermatology, calcium dobesilate (for example, Doxi­
Hem®) is often used in nosologies such as chronic venous insufficiency, rosacea, and etc. Calcium dobesilate is an inhibitor of 
endothelin­1 and VEGF. The drug improves the function and integrity of the capillary walls and veins, reduces the extravasation 
of blood and fluids and the formation of edema, and normalizes the physiology of lymph. Foreign data shows the effectiveness 
of both topical calcium dobesilate, approved by the FDA, and the experience of using the oral form of the drug in patients with 
pigmented purpuric dermatosis, but on the Russian market calcium dobesilate is presented only in forms for systemic use. The 
drug administration in these forms in the comprehensive therapy of psoriasis requires further clinical studies.
Key words: psoriasis, comorbidity, vascular disorders, calcium dobesilate, Doxi­Hem®.
