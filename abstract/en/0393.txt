The essence of the main approach to the treatment of arterial hypertension (AH), declared in the European guidelines for the management of patients with
AH in 2013, is that the main benefit of antihypertensive therapy is associated with a reduction in blood pressure itself and practically does not depend of the
drug which provides this effect. In the Russian guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, the key provision is also the need to achieve tar-
get blood pressure (BP). The brief review discusses practical issues of the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MCRAs) in the treatment of hyper-
tension. MCRAs are not the first line drugs for the treatment of hypertension. However, they play a special role in treating the resistant hypertension.
MCRAs also proved to have a positive effect on prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure. If the target blood pressure level is not reached during the
3â€“drug  therapy  including  a  diuretic  (resistant  hypertension),  MCRAs  may  be  added  to  treatment:  spironolactone  (starting  dose  -12.5-25  mg  /  day) 
or eplerenone (starting dose - 25- 50 mg / day).
Key words: arterial hypertension, spironolactone, eplerenone, mineralocorticoid receptors antagonists.
