Skin is a kind of ecosystem, closely connected with the body internal environment, its external environment, and is an ecological 
niche for many microorganisms. A balanced state of the skin microbiocenosis ensures the colonization resistance of this biotope. 
Application of antibacterial drugs, working in hazardous areas, sites of chronic infection, etc., can disrupt the skin microflora.
It has been shown that the high microorganism contamination of the skin (and its microbiome disorder) is facilitated by the 
structure and function of the epidermal barrier in chronic dermatoses: increased transepidermal water loss, changes in the 
function of the acid mantle, impaired desquamation and other factors.
The most effective as a topical therapy of chronic dermatoses are combined drugs, which, in addition to topical glucocorticosteroids, 
include antibacterial and antimycotic drugs, which allows acting simultaneously on all the links of the pathological process. Numer­
ous studies have shown that the combined drug Akriderm GK has a high therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of chronic dermatosis, 
complicated by bacterial and mycotic infection, makes it possible to notice the reduction in the duration of therapy, lengthening of 
remission periods and reduction in the number of exacerbations, improving the prognosis of diseases in the absence of side effects.
Key words: chronic dermatosis, epidermal barrier, skin microflora, skin microbiome, Akriderm GK.
