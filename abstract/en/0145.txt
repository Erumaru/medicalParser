Objective: To evaluate the role of physico-chemical properties of the gastric mucus-bicarbonate barrier in acid-base disorders and the influence on the bar-
rier of original rabeprazole (Pariet).
Main thesis. Patogenesis of acid-base disorders is the result of imbalance between aggression and protection factors. Leading protection factor is mucus-bi-
carbonate barrier. Its efficacy is determined by three key parameters: gel structure (main element is multimeric mucins), mucous film thickness and gel pH.
Double blind placebo controlled trials proved significant increase of gastric mucin secretion and concentration in patients, treated with original rabeprazole.
Conclusion. Therapeutic impact on protection factors in acid-base disorders remains an urgent problem of clinical medicine. Pleiotropic effect of original
rabeprazole (Pariet), which includes increased gastric mucin production and concentration, determines its priority use in patients with acid-base disorders.
