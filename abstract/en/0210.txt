Disorders of hormones production and hormones deficiency are important causes of many human diseases. D-hormone deficiency 
has negative consequences and causes a number of pathological conditions and diseases, which worsen in a menopause period.
A low level of D-hormone is found in overweight and obese individuals, along with arterial hypertension, peripheral arterial 
disease, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke. Low levels of 25(ОН)D3 in the blood serum 
seem to be associated with hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in obese people, low level of high-
density cholesterol. Many studies confirm the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and depression, obesity, polycystic 
ovary syndrome, infertility, etc.
In Russia, vitamin D is used mainly in two forms: aqueous and oil solutions. The aqueous solution is absorbed better because 
of the micellar form. This is due to the fact that it consists of micelles — nanoparticles with a “fat falling” and an aqueous 
membrane. The natural mechanism of vitamin D assimilation requires the formation of a micellar solution in the human body, 
which  depends  on  the  state  of  the  digestive  system,  the  meal  and  the  food.  The  aqueous  form  of  vitamin  D  (Aquadetrim®)  
is ready for assimilation when entering the human body, so its assimilation does not depend on a number of additional factors.
Key words: vitamin- D hormone, D-hypovitaminosis, D-vitamin deficiency, cholecalciferol, Aquadetrim®.
